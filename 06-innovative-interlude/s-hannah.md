# Summary of An Innovative Interlude
## **Renaissance thinkers**
-   **Giambattista Vica** was the first philosopher to come up with an overall meaning of history that was independent of religious thought and instead focused on finding *‘ the truth’* about humanity. However; he was influenced by earlier thinkers of the Enlightenment who were also independent of biblical thinking (pg 107),

-   By the 1530s, thinkers of the Renaissance had started to form theories about the sciences that stemmed away from biblical thinking. **Nicolas Copernicus** came forward with a new heliocentric approach, *stating that the sun was in the center of the universe* ( pg 108). **Johannes Kepler** published about his discovery on planetary motion and called them Kepler laws ( pg 108)
-   **Galileo**, an early thinker on the laws of matter, falsified traditional views. He wrote about why the church was against the new thinking, stating that it *disrupted the natural order of heaven, earth, and the universe*. He was locked away for his radical idea until Isaac Newton published on the laws of matter. (109)
  

## **Empiricism**

-   **Empiricism** was a practice during the Enlightenment for thinkers to ignore most previous knowledge and use only knowledge that could be observed and tested. This new way called Logic of expertise was a significant change since it almost wholly took biblical knowledge out of the thinking. However, theories then turned towards more natural-based thinking. (112)

## **Seventeenth-Century ‘ Rationalism’**

-   **Rene Descartes** believed in looking into the knowledge of nature, but that the only ideals that were utterly true were the ones that were achieved through deduction like mathematics. For all other experience thought to be accurate, it has to be proven once again. ( 112)

-   **Thomas Hobbs** focused his studies on the *natural state of man* and the state because he believed that truth was not about nature itself, but on the speech of people through the reasoning that could only be discovered by a philosopher ( 113). It would be possible to say that the nature of man and their actions have a direct effect on the telling of history.

## **Seventeenth-century political thought**

-   During the Enlightenment, philosophers also tried to understand the political ideas of a sovereign state and their role in society at that time ( 115). **Jean Bodin** laid down his theory as to why nations need to be covered by a single authority, deducting that any other form of authority would result in continued fighting among families of power. ( 115)

## **The Discipline of history**
-   The new idea for enlightenment thinkers was to reframe authors from putting in *their own religious, social, or patriotic views into their work when studying history* ( 119). Though this might seem impossible, it was also *noted that a lot of past accounts were written with influences on events and figures*. This early guide to history is still used today and is prominent for historiography.
