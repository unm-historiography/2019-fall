## An Innovative Interlude
---
Lemon, in examining the “_the first philosopher of history_” snatches the title from Augustine and crowns Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) clearly and precisely as “**intrinsically astonishingly novel.**”[1]  This alters the perceptions that Lemon has previous laid with his discussion of Augustine.

In recounting his ‘philosophical’ predecessors, Lemon leads us on a complex tour of Vico's predecessors and lays an interesting—and sometimes conflicting—groundwork for Vico’s distinctive approach.  His deconstruction of naturalist philosophy forms a synthesis of  empiricist and rationalist epistemologies into a decidedly different and synthetically innovative approach to the philosophical study of history, though Vico would apparently "regard his work as superseding rather than synthetic"(108) of the work of those who came before him.  As Lemon leads us down the path that is to become the foundation of Vico's reassessment of past thinkers it becomes easy to confuse objective with one that is an all too concise accounting of post medieval philosophers of science.[2]  This necessary trip down 'the rabbit hole' provides perspective on Vico’s departure from the positions of the naturalist philosophers.

As I recount the years that I have been a student of history (longer than I care to admit), I am embarrassed to admit that I was unfamiliar with Giambattista Vico.  Ironically, I am learning that my thinking and approach are not too distant from his.  I find it remarkable that Vico is a “relative unknown” when compared to renowned philosophers and political thinkers of the past.[3]  His seminal work--_New Science_ --created a paradigm shift in how we approach the ‘reporting’ of history and our conception of the ‘Philosophy of history.”  In reimagining the linguistic and conceptual means of communicating ideas of history, and every other scientific and humanities field, has left an indelible mark on all those who have followed him.  By divorcing theology and emotion from the discussion of history, Vico has establish the ‘ideal’ of how history should be written.  

Vico’s work should inspire all historians to be far more cognizant of how we present and defend our ideas and in the reporting of history.  His innovatively synthetic approach should guide us in minimizing our personal involvement in the historical materials that each of us produces.
