# _New Ideas in the 17th Century_

### Bias and Objectivity

It is clear in this chapter that Lemon is a fan of many of the philosophers of the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. Ironically, as Lemon discusses the birth of ideas of objectivity (and even cultural relativism in the previous chapter) he seems to be infatuated with the ideological and technical innovation of the period. While it is fine for Lemon to be a fan of these _modern_ thinkers, I could not help but feel that he was laying his own argument to bed by writing in a way which directly contrasted the ideas that were the foundation for modern historians. 

The importance of this issue is that it perpetuates the “otherness” and detachment addressed with periodization in the previous chapter. Lemon writes as if Galileo, Vico, Spinoza, etc. somehow accessed ‘sacred’ knowledge not yet available to man and still somewhat inconceivable today. I don’t think that these ideas were as ‘new’ as Lemon does, as illustrated below.

### New Knowledge for All and Points Lemon Ignored/Avoided

The scientific revolution introduced new ways of _allowing_ people to think and allowed **new** voices into the discussion. Along with the commonality of the printing press, access to knowledge had become much more available to all classes of people than ever before in history. Masses of humans who in any earlier time would have been essentially voiceless now had the ability to read, write, and think about things they never could before. The concepts of _rationalism_ and the _social contract_ also opened the door for non-elite voices to be heard.

I found it interesting that Lemon made no mention of the influence of America of new ideas and vice versa. Although mentioning Europe several times, endless references of American ideals were discussed, such as _pursuit of liberty/interests, indivisibility, natural rights, and majority rule_. The discovery of ‘new’ continents not only widened European perception of the world, but also gave thinkers something they never had before: an escape route. If someone wanted to publish something unpopular, America acted as a haven for idealists and innovation.

### As Long as it’s Religious

Incredibly, no matter how controversial a new idea might have been, all was accepted as long as it was tied back to religion, specifically Christianity. I think that was a clever loophole which most of the scientist/philosophers used in order to pursue their interests. Whether or not this was ‘lip-service’ or a true motivation, I think it contradicts a lot of our discussions of whether religion and science can be used together. Based on Lemon’s description, it appears that in many ways modern science was actually born because of religion. Questions people had about God, miracles, truth, biblical morals, etc. began the quest for what became the _scientific method_, arguably one of the most praised tools in academia today.
