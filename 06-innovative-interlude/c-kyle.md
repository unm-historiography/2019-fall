## **Summary Points for An Innovative Interlude Chapter 6 107-126 PoH**

### The First Philosopher of History

- Drawing from the works of **Augustine** and **Machiavelli** from the previous chapter, Lemon states how it was really **Giambattista Vico** who is accepted by many scholars today as being the “first philosopher of history”. Vico, contrary to Augustine and Machiavelli, “was the first thinker to produce an actual ‘theory’ of the course and meaning of history derived from objective study and the conscious application of abstract principles” (107).

### Nicholaus Copernicus

- As the Scientific Revolution unfolded, new ways of thinking in astronomy and physics conflicted with the traditional or ‘universal’ way of thinking. **Nicholas Copernicus** developed a radical new theory that opposed the old geocentric model of the universe and boldly suggested a new heliocentric theory. His work “stimulated other astronomers and ‘natural philosophers’” (109) to think in new ways. There were dire consequences for some supporters such as **Galileo Galilee** who was persecuted for heresy. 

### Scientific Revolution

- **Francis Bacon** founded the scientific principle of discovering truth in an objective approach. He emphasized the “value of observation and experiment in order to reach reliable, objective knowledge” (110). A few years after his death, “like minded individuals formed a society along the lines he prosed… [in order to] make a better world.” (110). Drawing from his framework, societies such as the Royal Society of 1660, the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1661, and many other societies emerged to explore the pathway of this “new learning”. 

### Science and Philosophy

- The term ‘philosophy’ derives from its Greek origin “lover of knowledge”. Prior to modern distinction between science and philosophy, philosophy was used in the general sense as ‘the study of the natural world’ or ‘the study of the nature of things’. Examples of philosophical study included “the study of law, theology, medicine, political constitutions, astronomy/astrology, and even history, were subsumed by the generic term philosophy” (111). The science and philosophy paradox met on common ground for the purposes of studying ‘the nature of things’, however, each discipline required its own separate body of knowledge to “detach the physical world as a field of study”(111).   

### Empirisism

Consequences of ‘new learning’ allowed scientists to explore findings centered on the framework of Empiricism. Empiricism is based on experimentation, observation, and rationale of studying the natural world. In other words, contrary to the rationale of Renaissance humanists or classical theories, this new philosophical though emerged that was based on “discovering a new set of presuppositions based on the methodology of actual observation combined with repeatable experimentation” (112). 

### Rationalism

- Rene Descartes is accredited as forming the skeptical tradition of scientists and philosophers that “are not prepared to consider any idea as true unless [he] was satisfied that the method of acquiring knowledge was indisputably correct” (113). In other words, it is the reluctancy to accept facts as being truth and drawing conclusions based on the known facts. He believed that rationale was based on the process deduction, innate to the human mind, to rule out presuppositions in determining the truth of natural things. As Lemon states, “Reasoning is the process of drawing out the logical implications of definitions” (113). Nothing was true unless it could be “proved through the demonstration certainty of deductive reasoning” (121).

### Religion and Biblical Criticism

- New ways of learning and adoption of scientific frameworks learned by scientists during the Scientific Religion raised many questions and criticism of religion, particularly Christianity, during the sixteenth and seventeenth century. With the contributions of Empiricism by **John Locke** and Rationalism by **Descartes**, scientists began to ask how the role of God played in the human existence. Some even going to the extent as to question the existence of God. After all, “Descartes vowed to doubt everything, including the existence of God, until it could be ‘proved’ through the demonstration of certainty of deductive reasoning” (121).
