# Innovative Interlude
1.There seem to have been some substantially large gaps in recorded history. In the previous chapter there were a thousand years with nothing innovative, followed by this chapter in which there was another hundred and fifty years spanning from Machiavelli to Vico. How is it that? Are there pieces of this puzzle being left out purposefully by Lemon? (107)

2.If Machiavelli lived a century and a half prior to Giambattista Vico, how is it that most scholars consider Vico the first ‘philosopher of history’? (107) Did they not have similar political? Why isn’t Machiavelli considered to be the first?

3.It seems to me that Lemon has revealed his biases through this chapter. Judging by the weight of the historical characters within this chapter, does anyone else feel that Lemon favors the ‘Hobbes-team’ over the ‘Locke-team’? (112-113)

4.Hobbes states, “whatever is the object of any man’s appetite or desire, that is it which he calleth ‘good’: and the object of his hate and aversion, ‘evil’.” (117) Then he goes on to state, “political order- its rationale is located solely in logic.” (117) Do these two statements seem to be contradictive? Isn’t one’s ‘logic’ determined/swayed by the inner biases from which they consider things to work the best, or ‘good’?
