# Summary of Chapter 6: *An Innovative Interlude* 


### Introduction
- The chapter begins with Lemon asserting that the century and a half that seperated Machiavelli, whom we have just left, and Giambattista Vico, whom we are about to encounter, was "far from a period bereft of significant and relevant intellectual development", informing us that "the intervening years were replete with innovation in the domains of philosophy, science, religion, political theory, law, literature, and history" (Lemon 108). 
- This chapter, then, will give us the necessary context to understand Vico’s work, though much of it falls outside the realm of history itself. 

### The Scientific Revolution
- the groundbreaking works of astronomers such as Copernicus and Galileo are briefly described, but perhaps more to the point is the fact that, despite the genuinely-held belief in God that most ‘Natural Philosophers’ held, the Scientific Revolution: “offered a new way of looking at the universe, a new set of presuppositions regarding the natural world and >man’s place in it, which sat antagonistically not only with the received wisdom of the ancient classics and >of the Catholic Church, but increasingly with the classics-oriented *humanist* heritage of the Renaissance” (Lemon 110). 

- Once the revolution reaches Vico, then history will be added to the list of subjects that is to be examined with a “new set of presuppositions”.  

### Seventeenth-century philosophy 
- Next among Vico's eventual influences is the beginning of modern philosophy, as we understand it today. The two schools of Empiricism and Rationalism though they differed in their methods, “shared views on the *question of method… as well as on the *importance* of method as the foremost key to true knowledge” (Lemon 114). 
- This focus on methodology was yet another new trait of seventeenth century thought that Vico (and, as we shall see, some of his immediate antecedents) would later incorporate. 

### Seventeenth-century political thought
- Here at last we begin to draw closer to the mark, though as we see in this section the study of politics and history have not always been so closely intertwined. Though thinkers such as Bodin with his works on sovereignty, and Hobbes and Locke with their discussion of social contracts “deliberately ignored” history in their political writings, Vico would not, and parts of his writings were in direct response to theirs. 

### The discipline of history
- At last we return to our own cherished subject. This section explains how, even before Vico, “the foundations of modern historical practice were laid” (Lemon 119). At last, we see historians being “urged not to interject their own religious, social, or patriotic prejudices into their accounts… to maintain detachment when studying recent events… to be aware of political or religious influences contraining previous historian[s]” Lemon (119). There are many historians today who would do well to heed that advice, let alone those of the 1600’s.
