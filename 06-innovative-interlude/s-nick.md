# Summary
**Introduction/ Vico**

•	Lemon is starting his assessment with the way we finished the last chapter with Machiavelli and leading into **Giambattista Vico**. To sum up he was interested in investigating the truth of human history by using a more **scientific and philosophical approach**. 

•	His major work was titled The New Science, which was a synthesis of philosophy.

**The Scientific Revolution/ Vico’s Intellectual Inheritance** 

•	This gives a layout of all the great minds that shaped the work of Vico, starting with Copernicus who came up with the theory that the sun was the center of the universe and the earth revolved around it. Jumping then to Kepler and the great minds of Galileo and Newton. These great minds paved the way for the **Scientific Revolution**.

•	To define the Scientific Revolution Lemon writes that, “In short, the Scientific Revolution was far more then the revolution of science… offered a new way to look at the universe....” **(p.110)** and took away the outlook on the way the Catholic Church sees and recorded history but with the more “classics-orientated humanist heritage of the Renaissance.” **(p.110)** 

**Empiricism** 

•	Lemon discusses how the main ideas of **Renaissance Humanists** did not give more attention to the study of the *Natural World*, but rather they were focused on the *Liberal Arts*. But with the concepts of New Learning growing in the 17th century it shifted the peoples focus on to the **Natural World**. 

•	Lemon defines **Empiricism** as, “the taking of ones starting point for knowledge from the observed, tested facts.” **(p.112)** this was to be known as the Logic of Knowledge would help to correct errors and discover new truths. 

**Rationalism** 

•	Works from **Descartes** and **Hobbes** gave principal innovation to the term Philosophy. Descartes states in his work that his philosophy was into the nature of knowledge itself. Lemon says that “he was convinced the only statements or ideas which are indisputably ‘true’, are those which partake of the certainty demonstrable in proportions arrived at through the process of deduction which is inmate to the mind.” **(p.113)**

•	Hobbes with his wok in **Leviathan** calls for the knowledge of Science and that is what is required in a philosopher. He looks to the idea of “true and false are attributes of speech, not of things.” **(p.113)** 

**Political Thought** 

•	This section brings together the works of Hobbes and Locke n the way we study politics and history, but it also shows that that both were not always viewed so closely together back then. 

•	*Bodin* is referenced first as the inventor of the notion **“sovereignty”**, followed by the comparisons and ideas of a **Social Contract** and how  at the time did not view or use history to argue their points in the academic works we study today. 

**Biblical Criticism** 

•	There was this Faith Crisis that took place that made all men question themselves on if they accepted God even if there was this wave of new scientific discoveries emerging throughout Europe.
