# Questions for WK 7 

Fredrick Meinceke defines Historism as “the substitution of process of individualizing observation for a generalizing view of human forces in History.” **(p. 69)** If history is interpreted by **individual observation** why is it important to record? Dose this idea also define and interpret history through the view of religion being the center view? 

Historical Novels shifted to the fashion scene where “some history painters, obsessed with accuracy, became collectors and experts on the **clothing, furniture, and architecture of the past**, anticipating the interests of today’s historians of material culture.” **(p. 75)** Shows like Antiques Roadshow on PBS explore this type of history and also certain museums for art and music like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Ohio. Why is it important for this style of history to be saved? What story’s or importance are these items meant to tell? 

In Thomas Gil’s work he seems to argue the idea that Scientific History and the Philosophy of History cannot coexist with each other at the same time. Discussing that leading ideas or **“dominant trends”** **(p. 390)** effect the way we interpret history. How do we define a trend and how does a trend define historical information? Is it because of a “trend” the Scientific History and the Philosophy of History cannot coexist?
