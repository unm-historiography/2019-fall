# Comment: von Ranke

Popkin and Gil seem to agree with one another and the academy of history over the importance and significance of Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886).  “[He] is universally recognized as the founder of modern scientific historiography.”[1]. The change from history being of the Augustine school—one of the key figures (rulers) and religion—or purely rationalist—that of Rousseau and the Enlightenment—to the understanding that historical significance exists at every stratum of human existence breathes new life into the importance of all humanity.[2]

Unlike the rationalists of the Enlightenment, von Ranke also breathed life into the concept of national identity.[3]  This directly conflicted with Enlightenment thinkers whose mantra was “[d]on’t try to follow the conduct of your ancestors, they had no principles to follow…consult only good sense, which is the same in all countries and all epochs, and the law of nature.”[^4]. His promulgating the ideal of nationalism was novel and a product of the formation of nation-states in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Insistent that historians “show what happened” (‘wie es eigentlich gewesen'), a statement for which von Ranke is well known, meant that the historian was to act as a reporter of the past.  This task is one which he in which the report must be made in the context of the period and devoid of judgment relative to the period in which the historian lives.[5]. Moralizing is _verboten_ in von Ranke’s eyes.[6], with **objectivity “undoubtedly [being] the supreme law**.”[7]

It is here that von Ranke shines a new and objective light on the study and reporting of the field of history, to include the fundamental philosophy of historiography.  Past schools of historiographical thought never made such a clear attempt to divorce themselves from subjectivity—though there are some who would argue the opposing position with regard to enlightenment thinkers—and recognize the nature and utility of national interest (nationalism) and its nature in gaining a greater understanding of the uniqueness of the formation and histories of nation-states.  His focus on “**the primacy of facts** (‘diestrenge Darstellung Der Tatsache’) is the most effective prescription for the historian’s work.”[8]

The question of the ”**national origin myth**,’ or ‘**mythistory**’[9] is not lost on von Ranke. As a historian, he did write on Garman national history but was not limited to this narrow area of study.  While acknowledging the importance of ‘**national identity**’ in the context of history, von Ranke also recognizes the issues that underlie nationalist histories, the biases involved in reporting one’s own national history and the underlying agendas.  On this issue, Popkin and Gil generally agree, yet there are divisions between them in terms of how close von Ranke’s philosophy is to Hegel’s.  Popkin seems to think that the two are philosophically more distant than does Gil.

In addition to von Ranke’s creation of the historical seminar,[10] the significance of his work can be felt today.  Of the various approaches to the philosophy of history that we have examined thus far, I have to say von Ranke’s is the one that resonates most clearly with me.  His vision of historiography strikes me as far more concrete than that of those who came before him. I find comfort in his view that “historians cannot ‘subsume’ the complex historical process under ‘concepts’ as philosophers usually do.”[11]  the idea of the division of the physical—material, scientific, and technological—and non-material—cultural, social and spiritual—progress in historical terms is a concept that is one with which it is easy to identify.[12]  Understanding that absolute objectivity is impossible—we as humans view everything through a subjective lens of one kind or another—his admonition to maintain our objectivity as students and professionals of history in the examination and reporting in our field is something that we all should strive to achieve.
