# Some thoughts (or comments, if you will) about some readings to do with Leopold Ranke
- Leopold Ranke was the first of the modern “scientific” historiographers, striving towards a truly objective account of past events, devoid of speculative philosophy. Ranke was concerned not with what happened, not necessarily why it had been so, at least in a philosophical sense. However, I see two issues with Ranke’s approach. I think his attempt to divorce speculative philosophy is a Sisyphean task, insomuch as he is trying to roll the boulder of rationality up the hill of human nature, ever to fail. Meanwhile, while I do not doubt his good intentions and efforts towards objectivity, I cannot help but wonder is his own historiographical approach was colored by the official positions he held in the Prussian government. 

- These questions aside, the fact remains that, despite the fact that Ranke’s own work “was carried out on the basis of certain substantive assumptions that came close to the main assertions of the philosophy of history he criticized” (Gil 383), the approaches he taught and used were, at the time revolutionary, and now, form the basis of historical education. The seminar approach, the critical evaluation of sources, and the insistence of avoiding teleology and avoiding judging the past are all hallmarks of the current historical profession. 

- Perhaps because of his conscious rejection of the idea of a philosophy of history, Ranke’s own ideas along these lines are “not systematic… [or] consistent” (Gil 387). However, like Hegel, Ranke felt that “the study of history was the best way to understand human nature” (Gil 389), though he approached it from a different direction, so to speak. 

- It is also interesting to note that Ranke, according to the Popkin reading, warned against the practice of getting too deeply into the weeds: “the historian  needed to avoid becoming so absorbed in the details of any one episode of the past and in the ‘pleasure of the particular for itself’ that he lost track of the broader meaning of his findings and ‘the universal aspect of things’” (Popkin 77). This warning is entirely, and somewhat ironically, in line with some of Lemon’s statements in his introduction to Speculative Philosophy of History. Thus we see the ultimate irony of Ranke, that in seeking to reject speculative philosophy, he unwittingly and unconsciously embraced it.
