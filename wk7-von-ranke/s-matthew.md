#### Summary of _Leopold Ranke_, by Thomas Gil

##### Ranke's Background
- Born in 1795, in Wiehe, he studied classical philosophy and theology, before becoming a teacher.  In 1825, he became a professor at the University of Berlin, eventually being appointed the offical Prussian state historian in 1841. (p.383-384)
##### Scientific Historiography
- Ranke's methodogy was a mixing of earlier methods: 
    * a critical attitude toward historical sources
    * use of original documentation
    * use of philiological methodolgy in writing and teaching history
* His work was based on four main principles:
    * the objectivity of historiographical truth
    * the priority of facts over concepts
    * the uniqueness of all events
    * the centrality of politics (p.384-385)
  
##### The Philosophical vs The Historiographical
* A power rivialry existed at the University of Berlin, between the philosophical and historiographical approaches to history.  While Ranke was in the later group, it would be incorrect to state that he disagreed with Hegel on all points, and was a pure historical technician. 
* The disagreements ranged from the primacy of facts over theory,the existance of historical law, and the historian's right to be a moral arbitor of the past. (p.386-387)
##### The Meaning of History
- Though immersive study of individual subject matters, through empirical research of documentation is key to the study of history, historians must step away, to find "the feeling of the whole", an act of **geistige Apperception**, which will allow an understanding of the movement of history through its details. (p.388)
##### Criticism of Liberal Reform
- As editor of the _Historisch-Politische Zeitshrift_, Ranke launched critisms against Prussian liberal reformers, as he believed their ideas to to be based on "abstract theory, and not on concrete realities and continuities."  History, not philosophy, provided the best understanding of what was needed for future governance. (p.389)
##### The National and the Universal
* While Ranke "had always advocated the reconcilliation of the national and universal in historiography," he made **world historiography** a focus at the end of his life, using national histories to reveal "thematic universal realities." (p.390)
