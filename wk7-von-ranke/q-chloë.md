### Question 1 ###
Did Von Ranke's approach to history, overall, improve or degrade the field? On one hand, his objective, scientific focus improved the accuracy of historical accounts, which could be considered an improvement. However, Ranke's focus, although more balanced in his own work, on totally objective accounts could create a somewhat dry narrative. 

### Question 2 ###
What are the most important differences in Hegel and Von Ranke's approaches to historiography, and, additionally, how much bigger were those differences when transmitted to their 'followers'? Although Von Ranke felt his approach was significantly different from Hegel's, would you agree? Consider their approaches to the meaning and recording of history while answering.

### Question 3 ###
Have modern approaches to history strayed away from Von Ranke's model? Consider the rise of blogs, podcasts, historical fiction, and other media used to convey history. In order to capture the public's attention, in this era and in the past, a compelling narrative plays a major role. Does this model improve upon Von Ranke, or does it compromise historical accuracy?
