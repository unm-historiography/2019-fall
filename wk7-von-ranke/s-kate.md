## Summary ##

### Gil Reading

- Ranke sought to find out what happened, unlike Hegel. In order to do this, he used a scientific approach to infer and weed out what was real and what a lie or a distortion of the truth. He felt that "the scientific study of history could only thrive if the philosophical speculations about history came to an end." (Gil 383). 

 
- Ranke uses four main principles when creating scientific historiography. These were "the objectivity of historiographic truth; the priority of facts over concepts; the uniqueness of all historical events; and the centrality of politics" (Gil 384).  These make up the backbone of scientific historiography. Historians should not be biased and leave history in the past and not use it in any way that would "benefit the future." (Gil 384). A historian should not rely on hearsay but hard facts. One should not look at all of history but look at each historical event as an individual, not as a collective. Lastly, politics play a huge role in history, as politics are connected to the foundation of the state. 


- Ranke believes that historians and academia should not so much focus on history and what it means for the future but, on history and what happened then at that time. Focus on the individual, not the collective like Hegel, and other philosophers of history have done in the past.

- A philosophical approach to history is looking at __the rational diversity__ of history where "truth can be found by reducing that diversity" (Gil 386). The historiographic approach to history recognizes the __individuality of historical events__ and the importance of that individuality. In academia, these two groups have been at odds with one another because of the overall difference in opinion when it comes to the whole historical process. 

### Popkin Reading

- The 19th century was a period where a significant shift took place in which history moved up in academia, and new ways of thought developed. Historicism being the new significant way of thinking. __Historicism__ was looking at the individuality of each era and civilization. 

- The revolutionary era played a significant role in reshaping the value and __consciousness surrounding history__. The French revolution saw to the preservation history through museums and the important preserving of documents. The French Revolution also saw to the importance of ordinary citizens no longer was history written by just the powerful but by every class. This was due to the role of citizens in the revolution. 

- Ranke was a significant contributor to Historicism. His contribution created Scieitfic Historiography, which puts emphasis on what happened and relies on facts. 

- For Ranke, history was about the individual; however, at the same time, other historians felt that one could generalize history and learn the "general laws" of society. One of these thinkers was Auguste Comte. He came up with positivism which is the rational observation of historical facts that gives information about the overall society. In contrast to this was Karl Marx who proposed that the economy caused historical change. 

- History began to sperate and branch away from things like archeology as it became easier to go back historically. The biblical story of the world was being studied and found to be lacking historical truth. By the end of the 19th-century history had permeated all of western thought and had become an integral part of academia as many civilizations viewed themselves and their histories in different lights.
