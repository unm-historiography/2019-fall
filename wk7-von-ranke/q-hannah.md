## Popkin

- Pulling from the section of Nationalism and Historical histories from the Popkin article, it talks about choosing between a nationalist historiography and a state historiography. During our academic careers, institutions have emphasised **national and world** historiography but lack state ones. Is this to say that a nation's history is far more important than that of a state?

  

- From Popkins article and what we have learned in class, we have seen the rise of the scientific process and using logic in **enlightenment principles**. However, should the scientific process be applied to history when history involves the analysis of human thoughts and actions rather than a controlled environment?

  

- According to Ranke, **scientific history and philosophical history** cannot exist at the same time as each other. Why is this if both can still be seen today though the analysis of sources as well as the teachings of reasons behind events?
