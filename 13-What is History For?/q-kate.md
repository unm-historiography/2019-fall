### Questions

- How can we tell whether one is doing history "for its own sake" or "in order to"? 

- For the majority of the chapter, Lemon talks about the possible bias in the writing and study of history and that someone may or may not biased on purpose. With that being said is the study and writing of history intrinsically bias? Why? 

- Lemon writes about how we can detect which type of history a person is doing by the quality of work. With that being said, if someone is doing it "for its own sake", does that mean they are less biased than someone doing it for the final product? Which one do you believe to be more biased, someone who is doing it "in order to" or someone who is doing it "for its own sake"?

- When talking about the many reasons that history is written, Lemon talks about 'truth' and 'impartiality.' How can we find truth and impartiality in history if the writing and motivation for doing history are possibly biased?
