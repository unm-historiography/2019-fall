# Are we just students pretending to be historians?

## Practically Motivated work.

In this chapter, **Lemon** explains the difference between the motivations of history, but it is during his discussion of practicing history that changes the view of the student. Lemon explains this in the section Practically motivated historical work **( 328)** in which he gives an example of a research topic which is in a familiar structure to any college student. Lemon states: “ *We have to assume the historian has already formed his view but is seeking evidence to substantiate his case”* **( 329)**. He clearly shows that a historian will already have a bias based on the thesis statement, which would then bring to the attention if it is possible not to have a bias. 

## How we are taught to be bias
It is easy to say that it is impossible not to have a bias, but is it possible if, through studying history, **we are taught to be biased**?  Now, perhaps being bias is not the correct argument, but its impossible not to partake in some side focused thinking. **Lemon** declares that “

>  we see that where the historian engages in his work of uncovering the
> past to achieve some (extrinsic) objective, he does less than
> ‘justice’ to that activity because of his ‘partiality” ( 330).

 From the intro to **Analytic Philosophy**, we already know that in academic writing, there is objective observation in which the writer is looking for information that would adhere to their argument. Thus this leaves out a large part of that particular history. Though students are taught to always include a counterclaim to their arguments, students are indeed taught through the school system to be biased in historical academic essays.

## Fake Historians
Now that it is clear that we are taught to be biased, does his mean that we are **counterfeit historians**? **Lemon** talks about this as well as, it would be easy to assume that students are pretending to be historians as we only write about one side of the story. However, Lemon explains that having a bias view is fundamental to history. 

> “ A motivated ‘historian’ is not betraying his discipline, since the
> threat of ‘bias’ or ‘partiality’ is somehow integral to it, making it
> pointless to complain, and meaning that those who do complain have
> misunderstood the nature of the discipline." ( 331)

. As we can see, being bias is a fundamental part of being a student historian, but this leads to the question of should we be concerned about bias work? Of course, we still should because it is essential of us as historians to determine why a book was created and which voices are purposefully being left out to strengthen an argument.
