Disclaimer: I know there’s **a lot** of other content in this chapter to discuss, but I’m using today’s chapter as a jumping-off point to talk about my own stuff.

### Is Lemon approaching ‘history’ in too pure a form? ###
Does a practically motivated history really never qualify as true history? In that case, do we really have any such thing as history? I don’t know where I’m going with this, but I do have a general feeling here that I’m trying to put my finger on. Lemon approaches practically motivated historical work by saying the ‘historian’ in question would be producing biased work. He says:
> “There will always be the uneasy feeling that a historical enquiry undertaken for a practical motive is thereby ‘tainted’, however excellent it might turn out to be” (330).

My commentary is starting to turn into a question post, but is this fair to say? Just as Lemon describes an uneasy feeling, I am experiencing it in terms of his argument. 

On the other hand, **I have no answer to this unease**. Lemon’s point is solid. He addresses that “objective truth is an impossibility” (330), and that much of his argument is contingent on the possible existence of impartial or objective thinking. In this case, what is the alternative, aside from historical work with no true practical motive, which is financially unsustainable?

### Okay, Lemon, you got me. ###
We’ve asked so many times about the point of history in this class, and Lemon mentions one I’ve repressed saying again and again: **for the sake of it**. I love this. He puts it perfectly by saying: “... it is possible to enquire into an aspect or episode of the past for no other reason than that one enjoys the activity involved” (331). Sometimes, the pursuit of knowledge, and/or one’s enjoyment of it, is really reason enough to engage in it. 

### In case anyone forgot that I'm a psych major... ###

Every time I bring up psychology, I think, “god, **no one cares**. As much as I feel like the two disciplines overlap, other people don’t see it that way.” And yet, here I am, doing it again. Granted! This time Lemon brought it on himself, so I claim no responsibility. Lemon talks about motivation at the beginning of this chapter, and makes the point that some fields, like psychology, already address motivations. However, he then wrongly asserts that this field only addresses “individual motivations” (325). I’ll keep it short, and just say that this is wrong. Specialties like [social](https://www.britannica.com/science/social-psychology), [developmental](https://www.britannica.com/science/developmental-psychology), and [cross-cultural](https://www.britannica.com/place/cross-cultural-research) psychology all inspect some of the exact same phenomena as history and historiographical studies. So please, Lemon, stop this.
