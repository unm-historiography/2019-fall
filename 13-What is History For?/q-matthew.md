### Questions for _What is History For?_

1. The chapter begins with a discussion of the differing motivations for those who both write and read history.  History "for its own sake" is clearly favored throughout the chapter, but Lemon makes it clear that "good" history can be created by those who are motivated by achieving specific ends.  Does this early concession hurt Lemon's argument, or does he prove persuasive by chapter's end?

2.  Lemon writing about ideology in historical writing concludes with "the claim by some that ideological thinking is not merely a feature which _may_ attach to people's understandings of the (social) world, but it is an _inevitable_ feature which can _never_ escape." (p.336).  If this is true, to what degree is our reading of history just a dialogue between our own ideology, and the ideology of the writer?  Does accepting this lack of impartiality make the study of history any less valuable?

3.  On pages 343 and 344, Lemon lists the ways in which a historian who writes history "for its own sake" can produce a more "true account" of the past.  Does this constitute a unique philosophy of history, or is it merely a methodological tool, which can be used by any historian, even one with more practical motivations?

4. Lemon makes the argument that narrative history can be created in an impartial fashion (p.346-348), using logical sequencing and inclusion of facts.  Is this truly possible, or does our choosing of what to leave in or out of a historical narrative inherently create partiality?
