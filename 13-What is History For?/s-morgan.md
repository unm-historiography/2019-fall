## What is History For? Summary: ##
-	The **intention** behind a history project is important because it can literally affect how sources are managed, interpreted, and used producing potentially a partial portrayal of history.
-	The “Final” way of producing history is to do history for its own sake: *“It is not practically motivated, so there is no pressure to cut corners, save time, substitute a more efficient activity, or (least of all) get someone else to perform it for us.”* **(327)**.
-	A “Practical” way of studying history is to learn from history in order to ”effect something via and beyond the knowledge gained” **(329)**. In other words, “Practical” history is when a historian wishes to gain something from history.
-	**Pros and Cons** of “Final” and “Practical” history
	 - By participating in “Final” history, historians are producing the truest form of history; history for history’s sake. **However**, this “truth” may still be biased by subconsciously dictating the narrative. It requires a historian to constantly revise their work and accept new facts **(332)**.
    - By participating in “Practical” history, the historian has already reached a conclusion that they wish to support with facts. Thus, a historian may ignore many conflicting facts for those which more readily support their thesis. **However**, despite “cherry-picking” these facts, it does not mean the argument is any less true, only that they are ignoring large parts of history to fill a desire **(330)**.
### Three Questions to Consider: **(339)**
1.)	Is “Practically” motivated history *useless* as a history?

2.)	Are “Practically” motivated ‘history books’ *reprehensible*?

3.)	Is a “Practically” motivated ‘history book’ avoidable?
