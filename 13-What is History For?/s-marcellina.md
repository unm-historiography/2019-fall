# Chapter 13: What is History For? Summarized #

## **Introduction** ##

- ***What is the point of history?*** 
- ***"What does it matter what motivates an individual to study history, so as long he or she             does it well enough?"*** (pg.323)

- Although we may do things good or bad, dependent upon what our motivating factors are, studying history is no exception to this rule.
  - Having certain motivations for studying history can distort someone’s view to the point that it is no longer history but something different all together. 
-	‘history’ is either indefinable or simply a catch-all term for different things people do 

## **Theoretical Preliminaries** ##

-	‘***final***’ vs. ‘***practical***’ actions
    - Doing something for the sake of the experience of doing it vs. engaging in an action of activity so motivated to affect some separate end, (***in order to...***). 
-	It is practical to expect that something done for the sake of doing it is going to produce something better than doing something as a means to an end, in reality, this is more dependent on someone’s skills or aptitudes. 
    - “*Thus, where an action or activity results in a tangible product (e.g., a garden a meal, a book) that product need not necessarily display in what spirit it was produced.*” (pg. 328)
-	Using this approach to answer the questions of, ***what are the motivations for the study and writings of history and how do those motivations affect the discipline of history as an activity?*** 
    - These approaches provide a useful perspective in understanding complex issues analytic philosophers raise about what history is for. 

## *Practically motivated historical work* ##
-	A historian’s work at uncovering and understanding something in the past in order to affect something beyond knowledge gained. 
-	The danger of this approach is that it can cause the historian to give a biased account or being ‘*partial*’ to his/her work. 
    - Because they are motivated by a certain point they want to prove, or view they want to share, their account may be distorted 
-	Does this mean then that the historian is betraying the discipline? 
    - This answer is dependent upon what we think the discipline of history should strive to achieve. 
## ***Historical work ‘for its own sake’*** ##
-	Enquiring into an event or aspect of the past for no other reason than for the experience of doing it. It is not done to achieve anything. 
    - The only sense of achievement would be the acquisition of knowledge and understanding. 
-	Because there is no practical motivation in this approach, in theory, the historian will ‘*do justice*’ to enquiring into the past because they will explore all angles of their topic in which it can be understood and none of their research will be ‘*irrelevant*’ or ‘i*nconvenient*’ to a point or objective they are trying to make.  
-	Being impartial however, does not guarantee that the facts a historian states or the conclusions they reach are true. 
    - “Impartiality is not a sufficient condition for saying things that are true” (pg.332).
-	The historian who ‘***does justice***’ to the application of historical work by taking this approach, doing it for the sake of doing it, is in essence a **theorist.** (***“since the principal marks of theoretical thinking are precisely that it has no axe to grind and is reflexive- i.e., it reflects on itself to guard its adequacy)*** (pg.333). 

## **Conclusions** ##

-	History is written for many different reasons, but the two most obvious distinctions are…
    - History written to serve a purpose 
    - History written for its own sake
-	**What should history be written for?**
-	**What is the point of studying history?** 
    - This question is best left open to interpretation because it is a part of human activity and whatever the objective someone may have for studying history, ***it is difficult to say that anyone really has a right to say what the point of studying history should be*** (pg. 356).
