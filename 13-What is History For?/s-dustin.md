# What is history for? SUMMERIZER 
-	**Theoretical preliminaries** Historical work ‘for its own sake’ “means to and end combined with intellectual activities” (p.325) 

-	**Practically motivated historical work** Not ‘history for its own sake’ but, one “so a historian can work at uncovering and understanding some past event(s) in order to effect something beyond the knowledge gained” (p.329)

-	**The communication of history** “why communicate knowledge of the past?” (p.333)
The ways in which history is communicated is through “books, articles, lectures, and documentaries” (p.333). What were the motivations for writing this history? Were they practical and objective, or was it done for its own sake? 

-	**Ideology in history** The catalyst for propaganda for any level/class of citizen in a specific society. It can be used as a platform to project ideas for 'positive' change based on the situation of the writer. Historical writings can be “used to express the notion that many peoples’ ideas can be accounted for, not as the ‘free’ product of their thinking, but as stemming from the position they occupy in society” (p.335). 

-	**THREE QUESTIONS** 

1.	Is such ‘history’ useless as history? 
2.	Are practically motivated ‘history books’ reprehensible? 
3.	What is history for?
