## Intro to Historiography Guide <p> -Questions ##

* Should language play a significant role in how intro guides for history are written? i.e. should simplest terms be used the most? 

* What kind of assumptions should one make about the knowledge of his/her readers and their knowledge or grasp about certain concepts of history? 


* How can concepts of history as well as philosophy be introduced to student’s unfamiliar with such topics in a way that does not overwhelm them with information, yet still engages their curiosity with such topics? 

* What kinds of questions should a guide such as this one answer for student’s in the beginning stages of studying history? and what questions should be left unanswered for more advanced studying later down the line? 

* What is the overall goal of a guide such as this one? Is it to engage all students, regardless of intended majors, to have at least an appreciation for history and why we study it? or is it reserved specifically for history majors to become better historians?
