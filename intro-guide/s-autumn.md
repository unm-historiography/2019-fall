# Summary
### Strengths
•	Very readable layout—legible typeface, well organized, familiar linear format makes it easy for readers to engage.

•	Offering both chronological and thematic interfaces is a great way to connect with a broader audience, as people think in different ways and get to choose their preferred method for accessing the essays. 

•	Solid writing—thoughtful interpretations, rich vocabulary, well organized arguments.

### Weaknesses
•	Subsections on left side of screen give little temporal context for those who don’t already know about ‘antiquity’ or the ‘early modern period’. Maybe rough dates following each subheading would help ground a broader audience, chronologically speaking, and give context for the timeline of these different eras. 

•	Some essays feature the author’s name(s) in the upper left corner of the essay while others do not. Is this just an inconsistency or do we not know some of the authors? 

•	Why is there a separate section for ‘Women and Gender’? Does separating women from the greater narrative of historiography not just perpetuate how they have been separated for millennia? Could we not place these essays in with the other thematic ones? Also, the naming convention is inconsistent in the ‘Women and Gender’ section. If they stay separate, should they not at least have consistent capitalization in their titles, like all the other essays do? 

•	Inconsistencies in bibliographical formatting—some are titled ‘sources’ while others are called ‘suggested readings’, ‘bibliography’ or have no title at all. 

### What’s lacking/missing
•	Pizazz! Design elements, color, imagery, sound, etc. could really elevate these essays. Especially if our audience is intended to be young students, graphic design could help draw their attention when the complicated subject of historiography may not.  

•	More links (like in the Greek Historiography essay) to sources or other points of interest. These could not only offer users an easy way to access our primary and secondary sources but could also lead to the kind of down-the-rabbit-hole research that gets people sucked into Wikipedia for hours.
