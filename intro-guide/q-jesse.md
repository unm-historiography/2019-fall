# Questions for the Intro Guide to Historiography
* An important question that we have been asking all semester and should continue to ask ourselves is who cares? What is the importance to the topic we are studying? I feel like these intro guides oftentimes did nothing to state the significance of what we are studying and this topic may become meaningless to many people without the overall frame of importance.
* Another question is how can we make this more readable for students? There is a lot of information in this guide and it is easy to lost in all of it.
* There are subheadings in these essays, however the information is still tough to sort through. What style choices would make these essays easier to get through?
* How simplified do these guides need to be in order to communicate efficently to young students?
