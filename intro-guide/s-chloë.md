# General Thoughts on the Intro Guide #

### Strengths: ###

Overall, this intro guide is easy to read, navigate, and generally explore, which means it’s more likely to be used. The women and gender section is well done, and although I first had qualms about it being a section of its own, I understood the need for it after some investigation. The fact that this section actually contains multiple essays is also encouraging. After most of the essays, the works cited sections are comprehensive and easy to follow, which should encourage further reading and discovery for the public. This also urges these readers (hopefully) to look at opinions other than those they’ve just read. 

The Early Modern and Antiquity sections seemed the most thorough, in the length of the essays, the amount of work it contained, and the readability of the works. The imagery was nice and kept these essays engaging despite their length. 

### Weaknesses: ###

There aren’t a lot of significant weaknesses in the work that’s already there, but the website does still seem like a work in progress. The “Thematic” section could probably use some work, though: right now it seems like a kind of catch-all for essays that didn’t fit into other categories. This is especially true because it has so many essays in it, more than any of the other categories. Another, smaller critique is just that some of the images on the website are oversized and pixelated. This just makes the site seem less professional and detracts from the information in the essays.

### What’s lacking: ###

I think I’ve made my feelings on the lack of Medieval representation in historiography clear, so I’m not going to hit anyone over the head with it. However, I would like to see at least one essay outlining some of the more important changes in this area, like changing dating practices or referencing previous historians. Aside from that, I’d like to see more historiography from non-Western perspectives.
