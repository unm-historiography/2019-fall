- Should Chicago Manual in-text citation style be used in the essays, since this acts as an introduction to historical writing and that is the more common style used for history?

- I like how there is a good _balance_ between academic yet readable material, but I wonder if there could be a ‘quick-guide’ or **‘historiography for dummies’** section to quickly break-down some concepts/key terms? As new college students, awareness of concepts like bias, presuppositions, facts/truth, arbitration (and the debates around them) might themselves still be foreign, so maybe having a key terms list could be useful?

- Could benefit from a _“If You Want to Learn More”_ section containing links, book/article recommendations, and names of historiographers, so if students are intrigued they can continue research on their own.

- For ease of use, should the embedded links, like in “Providential History” and many others, open a **new tab** rather than change the current page?
