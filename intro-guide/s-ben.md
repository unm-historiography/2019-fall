## Intro-guide

### What are the strengths and weaknesses of what's already here?

**Strengths**

-I liked all of the essay's that I read. I thought that they were packed full of _information_, but presented in a way that _challenges_ the reader while still making it _understandable_ to incoming students who don't have a lot of experience. 

-I got a Lemon feel while reading the essay's. They did a good job of looking at the topic from _multiple angles_ and presenting two _opposing views._

**Weaknesses**

-I didn't notice this a lot of the essay's but there was a few that didn't have a lot of the **bold** or _italics_ in the paragraph. That can make it hard for the reader to skim, which a lot of younger, freshamn readers like to do. 

### What do you find to be lacking?

-The biggest thing I found to be lacking was the lack of the _hyperlinks or pictures_ in some of the essay's. In  the essay's that did provide these the relatability for the reader was way higher than those that didn't. I think it the inclusion of these does nothing but help the reader become more familiar with the topic and the material presented about it.
