*History Wars: by James Hughes* 

**Strengths** 
•	Conflict between popular history and academic history.
•	The historical construction of national identities, nationalism and imperialism
•	He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.
•	This struggle for the authority and power to tell history expands beyond just distinctions between popular and academic history and which of those historical methods will become more commonly used by future historians.
•	Who has the authority to disseminate and mainstream historical works?
•	Good at stating arguments from multiple perspectives on specific topics.
**Weaknesses**
•	The author remained completely neutral on where he stands with the issues presented. This left me feeling as if I was not supposed to be done reading yet, too objective. 
**What is Lacking** 
•	Other than incorporated bias, I found there to be nothing lacking. 

*Histories for Everyone: by ?* 

**Strengths**
•	Universal histories, at their most fundamental level, detail histories which attempt to transcend particulars, the local and the singular, to form a narrative which applies to all the world’s peoples.
•	The author is thorough in covering past attempts at Universal history 
**Weaknesses**
•	The author states that creating a Universal History is both vain, and impossible. While I agree with the vain aspect, I do not think it impossible for there to eventually be a universal history agreed upon world-wide. 
**What is Lacking**
•	What seems to be missing is what is possible in the future for a Universal History.
