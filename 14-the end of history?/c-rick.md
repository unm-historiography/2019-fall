## Glorious Confusion

 - The maturation of “baby boomers” and swelling enrollments drove a rapid growth of universities in the 1960s.  Expanding employment created greater opportunities for future historians.   Through this, historical scholarship was addressing “new historical questions and new methodological approaches” that threatened to fragment the field.

### The Challenges of the 1960s

 - Social, cultural and academic uphill gave rise to a new era of historiography in the 1960s. What some call a splintering of historical studies might be more appropriately called a democratization of the field, expanding knowledge and understanding beyond the old conventions of paternalistic and Eurocentric narratives of history.

### Searching for a New History

 - The growth of data analysis in historical studies has enhanced the toolset of the current practitioners of history, particularly when combined with carefully researched and crafted narratives.(131-133)

### New Paradigms for History

[I will preface this with the understanding the paradigm shifts are rare and tend to assault the conventional wisdom of the period and field.  Most change is incremental as opposed to radical.  It is that new ideas force a radical shift in thinking rather than technical or methodological approach that leads to these changes being labeled as revolutionary as opposed to evolutionary.]

 - Coined in 1962’s [_The Structure of Scientific Revolution_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions) author [Thomas Kuhn](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-S-Kuhn), ‘paradigm shifts’ are described as a series ‘of entirely different models about how the universe worked.”[134]  Extended to history, a new paradigm is the result of “new ways of thinking about the past result[ing] form changes in historians’ notions of how individuals and societies work.”[135]

 - An example put forth is how the rise of feminism has driven questions about the fundamental assumptions about gender relations.[135]. The growth of the academic studies of women’s history and gender relations are a direct result of the evaluation of previous historically paternalistic narratives.

 - While [Paul-Michel Foucault](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault) and [Jean-Francois Lyotard](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lyotard/) held views that devalued the “grand narratives”[137] and recognized the role of language in historical analysis,[137] they took a more egalitarian view of all the social sciences: including history.  [Microhistory](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/23720) grew from this philosophical approach.

### [Women’s History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_history) and [Gender Relations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/gender-relations)

 - Women’s history and gender relations rose to prominence coincidentally with lilnguistic and cultural history[142] with [Betty Friedan’s](https://www.biography.com/activist/betty-friedan) [_The Feminine Mystique_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feminine_Mystique) pulling women out of the domestic realm into the forefront of historical analysis.[142]. The work was instrumental in the development of women’s history as an academic field from  the 1960s to the 1980’s as part of the [“second wave’ of feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism).

 - The [women’s movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_movement), women’s history, and gender relations studies proved to be instrumental in the multitude of legislative initiative that expanded opportunities for women in every facet of American society.[144]

### Contesting Eurocentrism

 - The 1970s gave rise to  academia breaking away from Eurocentrism in historical narratives .[146]. Works by [Edward Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said) and [Marshall Sahlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Sahlins) brought attention to the argument that “different cultural orders have their own modes of historical action, consciousness, and determination—their own historical practice,”[146] breaking with the Eurocentric cause-and-effect relationship in world history, such as put forth by [William McNeill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McNeill).  The diversification and regionalization of world history that resulted has added to the vibrancy of the tapestry of the historical narrative.

### History of Memory

 - The idea on a [collective social memory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25480359?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), conceptualized by [Maurice Halbwachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Halbwachs) in 1925, gained increased recognition during the 1980s “History Wars.”[149]  The use of collective memory seemed to be a veiled attempt at revitalizing nationalistic histories.[150]

 - History of memory was pivotal in the increased receptiveness of oral histories within the academic community.[151]. The integration of oral histories in the larger narrative resulted in a democratization of the broader histories.[152]

### The “History Wars”

 - Peter Novick’s 1988 _That Noble Dream: The ‘Objectivity Question’ has been considered the most significant historiographical work published in the decade, addressing the debate between objectivity and relativisism in the historical academic establishment.  [153]  He also identified new challenges centered on linguistics, the rise of feminism, and minority history.  His concerns were clearly voiced in the titles of several of the book’s chapters—“Objectivity Crisis”, “The Collapse of Comity”, and “Every Group Its Own Historian—exemplified the anxiety and rift that was pervading the profession.[153-154]

 - Historians gradually, and begrudgingly, accepted the increasing emphasis on minorities and cultural interpretations, a departure from history’s grand narratives of the past.[154]  The general public was slower to assimilate these new historical perspectives.[154]. Public perception was, at least in the United States, formed by mainstream media.[154]

 - Works that could arguably called **Historical Fiction,** such as Alex Haley’s _Roots_ and Gerald Green’s _Holocaust_ brought minority and cultural histories in to American and European living rooms in ways that had never before experienced.  In many ways events such as these shook the very foundations of public and academic understanding of the discipline.[154-155] “Better a misinformed enjoyment of history than none, a lighthearted dalliance with the past than a wholesale rejection of it.”[155]

 - Popular narratives of history left professional historians perplexed and contentiously debating new historiographical approaches,[156] putting them at odds with the the public’s desire for sweeping historical narratives with grand plots and and clearly depicted ‘good guys and bad guys.’[156]

 - As the “wars” were heating up in the United States and Western Europe, they  were far less threatening than the  debate taking place in the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe.[159]  Even as comparatively calm as the debate was in the West compared to the East, discussions were most certainly heated and rauchous, and divisive largely along political lines.[159-161]

### Bringing Closure

 - What we have seen in the espousing of [**postmodernism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) is in reality a diversification or democratization of the study of history in the many subfields that have evolved over the last 6 decades.  Rather than watering-down or fractionalizing our discipline, the development of these other areas of historical study have added a depth and richness to our understanding of the past and present.
