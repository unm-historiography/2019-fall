# Postmodernism and giving a shit about history

First of all, I don't think anyone could go through this class without having their minds changed about history. I think in some way, the whole point of this class was to change our ways of thinking about history. Whether that be learning about the difference between quantitative and qualitative history, or learning about cycles of time in the Roman empire, we were all meant to grow and change because of this class. 

## Postmodern Paradigm Shift?

This question is almost impossible to answer because both yes and no are correct. The postmodern movement has represented a paradigm shift in the minds of historians as well as many other academics. However, aren't we constantly in a state of paradigm shift? Aren't we constantly changing the way we think about and interact with the world? Without the paradigm constantly shifting, our world becomes stagnant and we stop ;earning and growing. We are contstantly pushing the paradigm and constantly trying to become better than before. 

## Rupture in our continuum?

If something ruptures, it does not build on what was before it. It rather destroys and wipes out the previous knowledge. Our history is a continuum and hopefully we are constantly building on our past. Our 20th century writing hopefully exists on a continuum and does not completely rupture but rather builds upon. I don't think that there is a time in history at all that has constituted a "rupture" in our historiography, rather just many small building blocks.
