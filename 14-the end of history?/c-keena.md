# _A Brief Review of Postmodernism_

_I think that when learning about Postmodernism in this course, it is important to remember that Postmodernism was not solely a historiographical movement. Postmodernism was a massive change in thought which deeply and irrevocably changed every academic field and common understanding of the world and how we are represented and represent ourselves in it. While the discipline of history was massively effected, so was how non-historians viewed and understood history._ 

### Application to this course

Thankfully, I had learned a lot about Postmodernism through my anthropology courses, so I knew what was coming. I have greatly enjoyed seeing how deeply this way of thinking has become common place in our minds today. As we've been making our way through Lemon and some of the earlier articles, students were often eager to ask postmodern-like questions. Even on the first day of class, issues of "truth" and "reality" were discussed.

For so long, these were not questions that were asked or topics that were ever discussed or even thought about. Today we think that these are normal questions, or even funny (as students will often laugh when another brings up the notion of differing realities), but these questions are actually extremely extraordinary and a key marker of our influences in the past century and our academic upbringing. _To even know that these are questions that can be asked is inherently Postmodern._

I definitely have caught myself thinking about our readings from a postmodern perspective. From the immediate concern of Augustine's eurocentrism in _City of God_ to recognition of Marx's structuralism and emphasis on "one" society, it is important to note that these are not necessarily things which were noticed, especially by historians/philosophers when these documents were published. While the postmodern view is presented as a more inclusive view, it is also a revisionist view, in which it is difficult to _truly_ understand sources within their own contexts. However, recognition of this is self-reflexive and, therefore, postmodern, so the paradoxical loop begins...

### Continuum v. Paradigm Shift

I believe that all of history is a continuum and there are no "ruptures". Ruptures are used as a way to disconnect ourselves (in the present) from the past. I think that all thought builds overtime and we cannot "un-think" something once we have had the thought/knowledge. Not necessarily in a positivist view, because I don't think that all of the accrued knowledge is "improving" or leading to some human utopia, but simply that once a thought exists, it exists and there is no un-knowing it. 

I think that the idea of "ruptures" is still a continuation of this idea that some humans are/have been 'better' than other humans. We need some kind of historical marker to either prove to ourselves that our species is barreling towards impending doom or to romanticize a 'purer and simpler' past. Because of this, I believe that true paradigm shifts are essentially impossible. Are there major changes in collective thought throughout history? Yes, all of the time. But, these 'shifts' are always built upon and influenced by the original pool of thought and cannot be truly 'original' if they are directly influenced.

### Other Thoughts

**On Lyotard's idea that metanarratives "override" historical realities:**

- While metanarratives do reduce and decontextualize the realities of individuals, I do not know if they should be written-off completely. Yes, eurocentrism tells a _story_ about history which provincializes the rest of the world; however, this was a felt reality by most of the world throughout Europe's imperialism. The way history is written, including metanarratives can, in many ways, reflect the realities of masses, even if it does not include its microhistories.

**Luddites**

- Why do we fear the technology we create and why do we create it? Baudrillard and Jameson with the television, us today with A-I technology. We, as humans, seem endlessly afraid that the technology we created is going to 'take-over' our ability to think. Existentialist and not really a question for this class, but I am curious.
