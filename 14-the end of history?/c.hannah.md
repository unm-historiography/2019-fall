# The absence of truth and the endless cycle of interpretation

One of the main ideas that postmodern thinking brings forward is the critical ideology of expansive interpretative thinking and the set in the stone idea that **there is no truth**. Truth is objective as it changes not only how individuals perceive concepts but how they interact with the function of the concept. 
	*A typical example is a debate about chairs, more specifically if a bean bag is a chair simply because we can sit in it*
A postmodernist would say **yes and no** because everyone's mental image of a chair is different. However, at the same time, a personal definition of a chair might **change over time**.  Another example would be, *"What is healthy?"* There is no single answer to this question at any one time. The reason for this is because everyone has **their own "true" idea** and that this idea has also changed over time, though it does not mean that one is right or what is wrong. It all depends on the interpretation of not only the individual but of the time that we are analyzing. 

## This Thinking is no More Radical than Others

Even the thought that Postmodernism is the end of all history is ironic because this statement takes away any interpretation for the statement itself. Though this shift of ideas might seem vastly different from others, what it is, **its taking snippets from each ideology and mashing them into a single labeled paradigm** that assumes that everyone is being affected. Postmodernists also imply to the extent that we have to abandon all previous paradigms or else face the wrath of scholars. There is **no set truth and, thus, no set methodology** that historians should use. Most people do not even notice shifts within their lifetime as most shifts can take a century or more to shroud over an entire world of thinking. 

##The End of Times as we believe.
Megahistory or microhistory? A postmodernist would have those believe that the times of megahistories are over and that microhistory is the new guide. Just like other ideas. **The new ones cannot prosper without the old ones.** We cannot write stories about the last few days of a soldier on Pompeii without knowing the overarching history of Greece. We also cannot say that earth-shaking events always meant the same by basing it on today's standards. Everyone's experience will shape how they viewed history and how history could be interpreted. 

## History is more alive than ever.

Though Postmodernism expressed the complete ending of history, this cannot ever be possible. Yes, it is true that history is being created every day, and to the untrained eye, everything might not seem as important. This new paradigm brought forth the **increase participation of interdisciplinary** thought but lacked the ideas to move cast interaction. When history is seen as worthless to historians, it does not just get thrown away but passed down to other disciplines. 

Items are given archaeological significance after 50 years; a landslide could have a historical beginning. History is more than just history now. With the increase of other ideas, old ones do not just die away and can be just as valid, or re-purposed to expose more subjects of study. 

## Closing thoughts

Postmodernism is a shift in the previous idea is just like the ones that came before. **Believing that they were the one "true" way and the only way that one should think.** Making the bold claim of believing that postmodern thought has it figured out now. Daily events are causing history to stay alive. Everyone will have their own opinion. Though postmodernism authority is not a threat to history, **it is a threat to the validation of individual thought and interpretation outside of their beliefs.**
