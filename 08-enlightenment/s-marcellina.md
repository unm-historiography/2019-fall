# Speculative Philosophy of History During the Enlightenment- Summary #
## Vico and the Enlightenment ##
- Because Vico’s writings and ideas did not become ‘relevant’ until the 20th century, his ideas did not play a role in the intellectual history of the generations that immediately preceded his generation. (Lemon,168). 
- Part of this was due to the growing of the new ideas emerging through the enlightenment period

## The Enlightenment ##
- Many institutions in place were being criticized, mainly the church and other institutions where different ideas and ways of thinking were not accepted. 
- This gave new opportunities for the ‘unthinkable’ to be published (Lemon, 169). 
- Although the ideas being expressed during the enlightenment were not entirely new concepts, what was ‘new’ is the way in which society was now being evaluated and its character rather than relying on the philosophical approach to life.
- Writers such as Voltaire, contributed many writings on topics such as the sciences, arts, morals and practical activities (Lemon, 170) which eventually constituted a 34-volume work. 
- This is what best exhibits the enlightenments criticisms and want for ‘modernization’ and reform and is also where we can see that the Enlightenment, from today’s definitions, embraced a philosophy of history. 

## Enlightenment ‘Philosophy of History’ ##
- Above all else, the Enlighteners believed in progress. 
- This progress was reliant on being able to examine other cultures for what can be learned from it. 
- Enlightenment’s foundation was built upon its’ belief in Reason and all the encompassing ideas that came out of the enlightenment were too simplistic compared to the ideas of philosophy and history that came before this period. 
- During this period, thinkers saw this period as a way for their society to move on from its’ imperfect history, to that of tolerance and history was seen as being in the hands of mankind rather than as previously accepted, in the hands of God. Already laid out. 

## The Discourses on the Arts and Sciences ##
- Rosseau very much did not share the same views as enlightened thinkers about history.
- Points to education as being corruptive and pushes certain values and ideas onto kids at a young age. Even criticized the invention of printing
