# The ideas of Turgot
## Progress and reasonable thinking
**Turgot** had a very different approach to the ideas of progress when it came to the philosophy of history. His thoughts were written out in *Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of Human Mind* ( 1794) which talked about his counter-arguments of **Rousseau's** theories. The first idea that **Turgot** has was that **progress**  was measured by the extent that humanity became more civilized through applying reason. This differentiation of his ideas was compelling in the fact that he used rational thinking in his measurements.  Regardless of if he was an atheist or not, it would have to put into the question if be believed that using superstition and religion as a mode of reasonable thought. If he thought that it was not reasonable, then it would be highly debatable when the first time humanity would have **progress** as up until the enlightenment. Before then, the bettering of society would have relied heavily on religion and superstition. 
## The power of Routine
Another point that **Turgot** makes is that:

>  But this is not to say 'progress' was easy. Instead, throughout
> history, the spark of innovation is held back by the force of routine
> ( 185).

This point, in my opinion, contradicts his whole idea about humanity **progressing** is in search of pleasure and happiness. Perhaps his theory of progress would not be able to hold up to our modern times as the rise of mental illness such as anxiety has arisen. Forming **routine** in this day and age is to maximize our pleasure and happiness by attempting to control our lives around us. Turgot could be correct in saying, in perhaps our modern view of progress as a collective would be benefiting the race as a whole. Routines then would limit progress as the active participation in a routine would severely limit the potential worldly observations in which he speaks of in order to progress and invent. As Turgot says,

>  to stall man in the rut of sameness... in a state of treadmill
> repetitiveness ( 185).

 Though I believe that he is not thinking deeply enough about routines. Although Routines, as the act of sameness allows the body to unconsciously follow the same pattern while the mind is allowed to wander off. There is potential for routines. No matter how repetitive, routines allow humanity to progress while completing mundane activities. It allows the mind to wander and think critically about the world while our physical beings are keeping us functioning.
