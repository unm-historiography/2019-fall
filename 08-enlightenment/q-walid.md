# **Questions: Chapter 8**


•	Early in the chapter there is the idea that modern history starts with the French Revolution in 1789. What do we define as
modern history and is this the 'best' point to 'start' it at?

•	How does Rousseau use history to justify his claims of the arts corrupting man and contrast that with the beauty of simplicity?
How is he looking at history?

•	Is Rousseau's philosophy on history less valid because of its lack of credible, direct evidence? Is a work more valid 
solely because it has direct evidence?

•	Technology, science, the Arts, and moral behaviour. How does Turgot's view on history and his thoughts of splitting history
into these four different areas compare with Rousseau? Is it reconcilable?
