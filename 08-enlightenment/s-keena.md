# _An Age of Criticism_

### Reason

**Reason** is distinguished as the enlightened form of thought. Differing from _opinion_ or _belief_, Reason was seen as rational and empirical. However, the concept of Reason is also characterized by the period's focus on **progress** and can itself be influenced by bias and human creation.

### Rousseau

#### Deceit

Early man lived in 'pristine ignorance', allowing _natural_ characteristics of honesty and straightforwardness. Arts and Sciences throughout history have caused corruption of **morals** and **happiness**. Men praise wit over wisdom. Main sources of corruption are _education_, _Intellectuals_ (except for the few _true_ geniuses), and _litterateurs_.

#### Inequality and the 'Revolutions' of Man

Man started as little more than animals, then progressed to the **'noble savage'** which was a morally deprived, yet happy human. Competition and scarcity forced improvement and dwellings, which divided families and gave men and women different roles. Then metallurgy and agriculture caused men to lose their independence to labor. The _natural state_ of man was replaced with war. Rich men created laws to protect themselves and their assests, creating the major equality divide. Human society will end due to a tyrant and become permanently unstable _(NOT CYCLICAL)_.

#### The Social Contract

A contradictive response to his own _Discourse_, Rousseau offers a 'solution' to the impending decline of society. Through **general will**, in which all men in a society relinquish all possessions and all members collectively determine the laws, then _perfectability_ can be achieved. To deny one's liberty is to deny their humanity.

### Turgot

Belief in human progress as the search for pleasure and happiness, acting as a _law_ governing human history. Focuses on the development of the human mind and rationality as the gradual understanding of reality. **Four** methods for monitoring progress **1** technological innovation **2** arts **3** moral behavior **4** use of reason to maximize independent happiness.

### Condorcet



#### Stages of History

**Ten Stages** of history defined in _Esquisse_.
1. Tribal: Hunter/fisher societies
2. Agriculture: Emergence of priesthood
3. Division of labor: Emergence of artisans, traders, alphabet, and fuedalism
4. Intellectual achievements of Greeks
5. Roman progress of Sciences
6. "Darkness": Fall of Rome - 11th cent.
7. Late Middle Ages: Restoration of knowledge
8. Renaissance: Printing in West
9. Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment
10. "Dawn": Future when **Reason** will emerge triumphant

#### Philosophy of history

The history of 'ideas', tracking progress of the _human mind_. History has been a battle between truth and error, in which experience and cumulative knowledge create progress. Progress is inherent and inevitable as humans desire to fulfil their pleasures; these theories are defined as **teleological characteristics**. 

### Burke

Societies are a complex historical phenomena, which are real, **organic**, and farer reaching than any person, place, or period. History **evolves** through man's reaction to immediate circumstances with an unforeseeable future; it is _practical_. The "_lessons_" of society can be seen in the traditions and conventions, which are small, slow changes effectively made over time. History is not 'tidy' and therefore Science and Reason cannot be used to study the subject.
