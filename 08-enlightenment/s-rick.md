# Speculative Philosophy of History During the Enlightenment
### A Summary
---
1.	**Introduction**

Lemon laments the neglect of Vico until the 20th century, laying the blame squarely on the significance given to ‘the Enlightenment,’ in which virtually all aspects of society were subjected to criticism.[1]  The rise of rationalism and empiricism, following ever so quietly in the footsteps of Vico and the work of **French Encyclopedists**—such as Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, Turgot, and Condorcet—gave birth to the modern ideal of the Philosophy of History.

2.	**Jean-Jacques Rousseau** _(France, 1712-1778)_

Rosseau, in constructing his philosophy of history, **introduced the secularization of history**; divorcing history from “God, ‘providence’, and supernatural teleology [2].”  In doing so his ‘materialistic theory’ was based on economics.[3] Like economic disparity, he believed that the level of inequity within a society determines the form of government.[4] This extends his influence beyond philosophizing on history in the the realm of political and economic philosophy.[5]

3.	**Anne Robert Jacques Turgot** _(France, 1727-1781)_

Following on the ideals of _Locke and Condillac_,[6] Turgot embraced the application of scientific reason to history; methods of observation, comparison, and experiment.[7]  As scientific reason applies to history, he believed progress—societal and intellectual—to be gradual and **driven by utilitarian motives**.[8]  Conceptually he believed in looking forward as well as back to understand the current importance of events and derive the best possible outcomes, a _utopian-esque proposition_.

4.	 **Marquis of Condorcet**, Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat _(France, 1743-1798)_

Like the Romans before him, Condorcet believed the history of mankind to progress in stages.  But unlike the 5 enumerated by the Romans, Condorcet believed there to be _9 past and one future stage of history,_[9] _each mapping a different level of societal complexity and development_.[10]  He subscribes to the **‘science of human progress’** with history providing its foundational lessons.  His views are firmly based in the utilitarianism view “_the greatest happiness for the greatest number_.”[11] Even with this in mind, Condorcet’s philosophy of history was reflective in nature, lacking in naïve optimism that might be expected of utilitarianism.[12]

5.	**Edmund Burke** _(Ireland, 1729-1797)_

Burke, rejecting the ‘rationalization’ of history, was _an intuitive thinker_,[13] believing history and **societies to be** “immensely complex,” such that they are **irrational and indeliberate**.[14]  In some ways, his views are _Lockean_ in nature,[15] yet there are irreconcilable inconsistencies in his views.  He described societies as ‘**organic**,’[16] a function of adaptation—evolution—as opposed to design.  The same holds true for his view on the ‘history of mankind’ as a “_nonsensical rationalist abstraction_", nor did he subscribe to the concept(s) of cyclic or recurrent history.  In Burke’s eyes “**history tells us nothing” yet “it tells us everything**."[17]

6.	**Conclusion**

In his conclusion, Lemon foreshadows the coming chapter on Hegel.[18]  In quoting Sabine, lemon makes it clear that while **Burke**’s ideas originate from an man of “powerful intelligence”, “he **could not have given systematic form to them**.”  What Burke intuited, Sabine and Hegel later rationalized the “logic of history.”[19]  Lemon leaves the reader with his typical ‘_you decide_.’
