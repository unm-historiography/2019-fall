#Comments on Chapter 8

Lemon at the beginning of the chapter seems very upset with the neglect Vico’s work was going through during the 20th century. Saying that his work never played a roll in the intellectual history, and the neglect only grew with the passing times of the Enlightenment. Lemon states that, “Vico’s ideas sat uneasily with the developing intellectual fashion.” **(p. 168)** and what’s interesting was his outlook on the idea of rationalism, and with the work of other French Scholars this helped give birth to the idea of **Philosophy of History**. 

While reading I was very fascinated by the work of Rousseau, Lemon explains that, “The constant theme is the contrast Rousseau draws between the damaging moral effects of the artificial ‘civilized’ society and the straightforward virtues of ‘natural’ man uncorrupted by the lure of luxury and sophistication.” **(p. 172)** he further goes on to tell us that Rousseau blames the way **Education** has been taught and used in are younger ages to corrupt our judgement, and the **Intellectuals**. This idea that we need change the mindset of the natural man to focus on sciences because it is viewed and seen as the light over the Horizon. 

I do apologies for this long next quote ill be using but to skim if down would take out some key ideas I feel. Lemon states, “What Rousseau has done is propose an understanding of human history which excludes God, ‘providence’, and supernatural technology; avoids the notion of recurrable ‘cycles’ as much as it does to determinate unilinear future; does not deny the obvious fact of ‘progress’ in the arts, sciences, and technology, and yet still finds a ‘meaning’ or ‘significance’ of human history – not in such ‘progress’, but elsewhere; namely, in the nature of man’s consciousness of being in the world.” **(p.180)** What is intersting is if we are to take out God, and his devine power it seems we are changing the paths we will take in our lives and futures. The cycles of religious perspectives of history leading to the notion of Heaven and Hell will still clash with sciencs but man will be focused of the world and bettering the world rather then his everlasting life.
