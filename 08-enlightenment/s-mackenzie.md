# Summarizing "During the Enlightenment"
### Enlightenment Thoughts
Coming from the birth of reason and empiricism, Enlightenments intellects began to apply this mode of thought **"fearlessly" to "society's instructions, practices and beliefs"** (pg. 169). They moved from a strictly policital look at history studying Kings and previous governments to a more anthropological view, trying to understand the origins of mankind.
### Rousseau
Rousseau was born in Geneva but moved to Paris at age 30 (pg. 171). He came 50 years before the Revolution and 30 years after King Louis XIV died when Paris had become a cultural hub and intellectual rival to many empires. His fame came from the **condemnation of the greater importance of arts, science, and technology** on man. Arguing they were "**damaging [to] moral effects** of the artificialities of 'civilised society and the straightforward virtues 'natural' man uncorrupted by the lure of luxury and sophistication." (pg 172). 
### Rousseau's Philosophy of History
Rousseau's philosophy of history was defined through **excluding God, 'providence', and supernatural telology** and by avoiding **recurale 'cycles'** (pg. 180). The importance of history was to understand the degradation of man. History is used to see the progress of _the nature of man's conciousness_.
### The Noble Savage
The idea of the Noble Savage supports how Rousseau viewed mankind as a simple concept at the core. Every man was born and brought from a simple animalistic state, **"sharing the physical virtues of robustness, keen sense, health, and simplicity of purpose."**(pg 174). The savage behavior seen in a contemporary society are not bad but explained through history. The defining key to man is the _'faculty of self-improvement'_ which brings man to further prgoress his own mentality and purpose in society (pg 174).
### Condorcet
Condorcet was a _scientist-policy-maker_ in paris during theage of the French Revolution and the years preceding. Condorcet moved away from history as a philosophy or a literary art and into a science. 
> History is the interplay between man's intellectual and fulfillment of his needs and desires, and progress occurs when intellectual innovations break down the resistance of traditional ways of doing things and change the way people live (pg 188-189)

This quote is a statement made by Lemon to sum up the ideaology of Condorcet on history and it's involvement in daily life. Without history there is very minimal research to understand how mankind works.
### The Ten Stages of History
This idea was a further argument to making history a science by Condorcet. _Starting out as small tribal societies and moving into the contemporary metropoles of rationalism and science_(pg. 189-190). The ten stages do not give proper names to each time period just a number, simplifying the Middle Ages or the Reformation, or any other time periods to look at them from a more unbiased frame of mind. Though like most people utilizing history, the tenth stage predicts the future and how **rationalism and science in government would look** (pg. 193. Affecting many people to also wonder the same.
