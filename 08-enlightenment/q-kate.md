## Questions: Chapter 8

In the *Philosophy of History*, Lemon states that “today’s historians date the beginnings of ‘modern history’ from the 1789 French revolution and Napoleon’s succeeding revolutionary wars” (pg. 278). In your opinion when did ‘modern history’ begin? And why? What marks the beginning?

With the enlightenment, there was more of a separation between society and the church. How did this “secular outlook on the ‘meaning’ of history” (pg. 281)  influence the cyclical way of thinking about history and society?  

What are the significant differences and similarities between __Vico’s philosophy of history__ and __Rousseau’s philosophy of history__? Is one more cyclical than the other? 

Lemon writes that previous thinkers influenced many of the enlightenment figures? Why do you think the enlightenment happened when it did? __What are differences between enlightenment thinkers and renaissance intellectuals?__

In many of the chapters, there has been a mention of __human progress__. In this chapter, Lemon writes that Condorcet believed that human progress could be measured with the progress of rational knowledge (pg. 314). Is history a tool that could be used to measure human progress, or should it be measured by things like scientific achievement? Why?
