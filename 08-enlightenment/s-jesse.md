## Summary of Chapter 8
### The Enlightenment 
* "The enlightenment, then, was above all an age of criticism and its practitioners understood this to mean the fearless application of *reason* to society's institutions, practices and beliefs" (169).
* "However, if there was nothing fundamentally new about the philosophical *foundations* of Enlightenment thought, what *was* new was its intense focus on the character of *society* rather than on the abstractions of philosophy" (170). 
* The Enlightenment was a time of progress in society.
* One of the key thoughts of the Enlightenment period was their acceptance of the philosophy of history. "In seeing their own time as (at last) the Age of Reason, they looked back at history as the movement of humanity from its initial imperfections of ignorance, stupidity, barbarity, and superstition towards the eventual enlightened state of knowledge, intelligence, tolerance, and reason which offered the ultimate achievement of the perfectibility of humankind" (171). 

### Condorcet
* Condorcet was one of the most influential thinkers of the Enlightenment period. He was one of the main thinkers that studied the significance of human history.
* "In short, he tried to make systematic sense of his views on the significance of human history, views in his case strongly influenced by his knowledge of the history of science. Also he was clearly influenced by Turgot's ideas regarding 'progress' in history and by the latter's intuitions about the prospects which a 'social art' based on 'positive' social science held for the future. However, he differed from Turgot in being unambiguously atheistic, and this perhaps allowed him a bolder view of history and a more radical tone" (187). 
* Condorcet was also famous for his 10 stages of history. These solidified the idea of progress though time and gave clear examples of the progress of different societies.
