# Schools of Historiographical Thought, Philosophy of History, and Their Real-World Utility (in 800 words or less)

History can be viewed in a number of contexts.  Whether the chronicling of events--the occurrence of events in over passage of time—or the broad-reaching ‘art’ of speculating the broad-sweeping of influences of historical events, the expansive reach of the historical understanding embraces each end of the spectrum and every nuance in-between.

Coined by Voltaire, the “philosophy of history’ is this all-encompassing spectrum of historical understanding and analysis, from the macro to the micro level [^1].

Chronicling provides an understanding of the ordering of events [^2].  This time-linear record of events provides a foundation to reach into the next level of historical understanding: contextualizing the societies and personalities within blocks of times, or eras, and the influences of neighboring eras, societies, and personalities.  It follows that the subsequent levels of historical understanding involve getting inside the heads of both the key personalities and their influencers.  

The understanding discussed thus far is that of analytic or critical history based on the evidence model of research.  To borrow a common term, this is the “down in the weeds” method of understanding the world.  It is here that historians use the materials they can actually lay their hands on—written records, letters, archeological evidence, and collateral accounts—to reconstruct the events at the focus of the investigation and the more ephemeral activities that affected endeavors and personalities to derive the finer points of the historical events. 

On counter-point, speculative history takes the research from “in the weeds” to the “30,000-foot” level.  This is viewing world events if broad, far-reaching strokes [^3].  By examining events from a more distant viewpoint, historians attempt to gain a greater understanding of the interrelationships between macro level events, their regional influences, and impacts on adjacent eras.

History, when used as a tool, provides a greater understanding of people, events and the relationships between them.  In this view, the observer may use these observations of the past to better inform themselves of possible outcomes in the near future.  But be forewarned, the further out in time the projection reaches the less reliable the predictions become and the great the number and severity of unintended consequences.  Even short-term forecasts based on historically similar circumstances are fraught with risk.  That said, this is the most reliable model available [^4].

Further, history is a lens into the past that affords a better understanding of whence a people came.  It is in this realization of the lineage of the past that identities are forged—personal, ethnic, regional, and national—instilling a sense of communal awareness.  Insightful analysis of the formation of collective identity, its origins, influences, and the trans morphing of shared consciousness over time is critical to the understanding every area of historical research and the impact of societal influences of the primary actors and influencers of a given time and place.

The methodology of researching, documenting, and communicating history is the realm of historiography.  This provides the framework and ethical foundation for the construction of historical products.

The philosophy of history is, according to Voltaire, the bridge between how we think about, study, and apply history [^5].  It provides historians a framework for ‘filling in the gaps’ when “existing disciplines or accepted rules” do not apply [^6].  It is here that the ‘thought exercise’ [^7] of the enlightenment’s great mind spur the creativity and unconventional thinking to overcome the flaws inherent in the existing system.

In this context both historiography and the philosophy of history are not only convenient constructs but also essential tolls both inside and outside the realm of academia.  The application of historiographical methodology is foundational in the public and private sectors.  Historiography teaches the methods for the research, analysis, and communication of information in a responsible, accurate, and influential manner.  Here the student gains greater understanding of historical context and the impact of consequences, intended and unintended [^8].

Through the understanding of the philosophy of history critical analysis skills are honed.  With heightened critical thinking comes greater creativity and coping with the unknown and the unexpected [^9].

Failure to grasp either historiography or the philosophy of history, within and without academia, places one at a distinct disadvantage personally and professionally.  The structure of one and the creative freedom of the other are complementary [^10].  With these tools one’s success is greatly enhanced at work and in life.
