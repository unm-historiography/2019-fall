# *The Houses of History*, "The *Annales*" 

- The Annales ‘school,’ named for the title of their journal, *Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales*, broke down divisions between history and other social sciences, “arguing that **all aspects of a society were part of historical reality**” (88).

- Fernand Braudel’s approach to time and space, similar to some contemporary anthropological work, **described temporal and geographical phenomena in relative terms, and explored the relationships between geographic features and the people who lived on or around them**, thus the Mediterranean Ocean is said to stretch as far north as the Baltic, and East to India, not literally, but in terms of the influence of that sea and the societies who grew and died along its shores. (88-90)

- Braudel’s successors continued his heavy use of statistics, and took that focus even further as new tools such as early computers began to be available, **developing the field of quantitative history** (91)

- In the 1970s, the *Annales* school again changed focus, to **examine “the inner workings of society” through the lens of individual experiences**. In many cases, this examination, which was done through not only textual sources but by analysis of images, oral histories, and music, overturned Braudel’s earlier ideas of geographical or ecological determinism, once again assigning agency to human actors (91-93)

- Criticisms of the *Annales* school include the **lack of a “meta-narrative**,” the **lack of applicability of its methods to fast-moving, post-industrial societies**, and that “**women are frequently ignored” in many works**. (93)

- Though originally concentrated to France, **the influence of the *Annales*” school expanded in the 1970s** as many of the journals works were translated into English. 

- The most important effects of the *Annales* were their “**search for underlying structures, their attempt at total history and their use of the methods and subjects of the social sciences**” (94)
