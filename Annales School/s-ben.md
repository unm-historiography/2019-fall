# Annales School

-In the 20th century we see yet another shift on the powers that be look at history and try to analysis why things went down the way they did. This time we see scholars classified in the historical thinking group _Annales school_.

### History of historical thinkers

-The foundation was started in 1929 with the publication of the journal **Annales d’historie economique et sociale by Lucein Febvre and Marc Bloh**. These new thinkers didn’t like history being dominated by political and diplomatic topics. (Green and Troup, pg 87)

-The next step was two decades later with **Fernand Braudel published La Mediterranee et le monde Mediterraneen a l’epoque de Philippe II**. His focus was quantitative history where it is all about the stone, cold stats. (Green and Troup, pg 87)

-The third generation Annales thinkers focused on mental structures of past societies. (Green and Troup, pg 87)

### Philosphy 

-The two main charter members differed slightly in their approach. **Febvre** looked at the geographical background of an area and that affected that areas social, cultural, and political development. (Green and Troup, pg 88)

-**Bloch** instead wanted to analyze the material structure of society. He broke down how each group interacted with other groups in areas as well as customs and rituals of property transfer and ownership.  (Green and Troup, pg 88)

-While these two seemed to be destined for a collision they actually meet in the middle with the theory of historie totale or total history. This is simply a thought process where one takes all aspects of society into historical reality. (Green and Troup, pg 88)

### The Mediterranean

-**Braudel’s** most famous, The Mediterranean, addresses time in a way never seen before. 

-The first level is the _geographical level_. This is where change happened at a very slow level like swelling current at a slow, but perceptible rhythm. Happened in 10 to 50 year cycles. (Green and Troup, pg 89)

-Second level was the medium speed economic cycles, trade, population fluctuation, and prices. Changes at this level happened faster than mother nature. (Green and Troup, pg 89)

-Third level is historie evenementielle (eventual history). The short time of discrete events (Green and Troup, pg 89)

-The exerts of the **Mediterranean**, for our reading, we see an example of how many aspects of society that the Annales school would look at. It looks at the types of agricultural resources they have along with the societal structure. It mentions how you can’t tell if anyone has assumed the role of leader as everyone seems to have similar roles. Their clothing is rags held together by string and work in the village is physically demanding, having to move rocks by hands due to slippery mountain sides. (Green and Troup, pg 98-109)

### Microhistory

-**Microhistory** seeks to define and measure them with reference to multiplicity of social representation they produce. (Iggers, pg 110)

-**Microstoria** introduces a platform for historians to not only transmit their finding but also their procedure in which those finding came about. (Iggers, pg 110)

### Problems with microhistorians

-Incapable of dealing with politics.

-reduced history to anecdotal antiques 

-romanticize past cultures. 

-can’t deal with modern or contemporary societies with rapid changes (Iggers, pg 113)
