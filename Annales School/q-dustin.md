The “role political beliefs play in the scholarship of historiography” of both old and new is a very interesting correlation (p.102). Is there sufficient evidence that this correlation also produces causation for certain major historical events, and how they were recorded, and or published and prescribed in academia? 

This shift of historical focus from the center of powers to the ‘many’ in order to “rescue the unknown from oblivion”, so that there are Histories, and not a History (p.103) Does anyone else think that for national/international history to be correctly interpreted and documented it needs to be from someone outside of the many? I would not select Joe Schmoe with a 9-5 job and conventional family to give his opinion in the form of published and prescribed academics, would you? Kocka would side with me as he stated “concentrating on the small rather than the large renders historical knowledge impossible and leads to the trivialization of history (p.105).

“Correctness means conformity to an order of things that has been defined by a discipline or an institution” (p.110) So, is the correct view on history the one that is the most popular when ‘you’ are alive? How then does ‘progress’ ever occur? 

# The Annales

The Annales School foundations were established when the French journal Annales d’historie économique et sociale began publication in 1929. Led by Strasbourg professors Febvre and Bloch to provide history not simply based on politics and diplomacy, but with material, social, and cultural aspects more heavily focused on. While these are necessary to record accurate history, can they ever be viewed as positive if they are not rooted with bigger-picture political and diplomatic foundations? 

Braudel’s influence on history based on quantified data was a huge step for historians. If not for his influences, do you think collaborative history would be as far as it is in the present day? Would there be a more, or less accurate ‘total history’?
