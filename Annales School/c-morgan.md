## Qantitative History/ Micro vs. Macro: Pros & Cons

The “Quantitative” history reading interested me a lot. I liked the idea of incorporating social science standards into the realm of history. As someone who grew up with scientific standards such as the **‘scientific method’** and was stressed the importance of data collection/interpretation, it only makes since that historical conclusions should come from these same standards. More so, quantitative history *opens up many routes of analysis of the past leading to historical conclusions that were inaccessible before*. Take, for example, early **Mesopotamian societies**: there is little that remains of their societies but often we find *cuneiform tablets* with financial records on them. At first glance there is little to be gained from these tablets, but a quantitative historian might discover *their main source of food, the city’s political relationships, routes of trade, cyclical events, and calendar understandings*; **all from analyzing the numbers**!

Quantitative history is awesome, **but it has limitations**. For example, when assessing the **WPA narratives** a statistically large number of ex-slaves will recount that their time as a slave *“wasn’t so bad”*. The master punished justly, there was always food to be had, and communities were close. **A quantitative historian would eventually conclude that slavery as an institution also must be “not that bad.”** Yet a **traditionalist historian** would recognize that the numbers presented in the WPA narratives were **skewed**; the WPA narratives were recorded during the *great depression, segregation, and KKK presence*. This means elderly ex-slaves would be **more likely look to past as favorable**: citing the abundance of food when presently they had no food. The interviewers of the WPA narratives were also white people and in a time of extreme segregation and racial tensions, the **elderly black community** were prone to not speak ill of their **white** masters to a **white** interviewer.

This leads me to the conclusion that quantitative history is a great **tool** for historians but it should only be that: **a tool**. *I do not believe this should replace existing methods history but instead help to supplement and perfect practices currently*. My opinion of quantitative history would also mirrored in the great debate of **macro versus micro historians**. We cannot begin to learn from the evidence individuals if we do not have a **contextual understanding of the bigger institutions of society**. Likewise, we cannot understand the full impact of institutions/events/eras if we do not look at their **impacts on the individual**. *Macro and micro outlooks must go together hand in hand just as quantitative and traditionalist history must*.
