## _Macro to Micro and the Effects of World War II_

World War II effected the world in so many ways, but its influence over intellectual thought continues to astound. Up to the mid twentieth century, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, academic thought ascertained a bandwagon of followers of _positivism_. This line of thinking was built on the foundation of human progress, cumulative knowledge, and continuous growth towards the epitome of the species. Then, one of the most massive events in modern history occurred, which made everyone question human nature and the concept of progress.

As our studies encroach nearer contemporary history, we can steadily see the increase in the realization of history **as it's happening**. Real-time observations of historically impactful moments, which starkly contrast our earlier studies of historians who routinely fixated on key events or leaders in ancient history, often with romanticizing or primitivizing lenses. The Annales school of thought and focus on _microhistory_ seems to be putting much more emphasis on self-reflection and individual agency within a society.

The macro to micro shift appears to be a perception shift more so than an academic shift. Whereas macro uses "sign and symbols" to understand a society, micro observes a society in order to understand the "signs and symbols". This shift is a clear representation of the awareness of the individual life and its importance after WWII. Prior, societies were generalized and viewed as a 'whole', but now a society is viewed as the make-up of numerous individuals with unique experiences. 

The events of and following WWII better explain this emphasis to _re-humanize_ history, to ensure that marginal voices and experiences and being heard. I think this can also be traced to the reasoning for the disinterest in writing about leaders because there was the real-time realization and fear that writing about Hitler or WWII could easily be distorted or romanticized over time; whereas, individual stories and experiences were much harder to refute or tamper.

In line with this newfound awareness of self-reflection and agency, it makes sense that these same historians lobbied for self-identification of biases within their texts and a greater effort to understand history within its own **context**. Studying _mentalites_, or the mental-state of the past, became key to obtaining the goal of representing histories over one, uniform, irrefutable history.
