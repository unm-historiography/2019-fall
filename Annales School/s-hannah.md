# Summary for Oct 2nd 
## Macro- to Microhistory

- **Kocka** believed that critical historical social science was supposed to reveal the ancient aspects of society that were hold back humanity from teaching a complete modern society. This idea paved the way for cultural anthropology to turn from exotic populations and look towards modern or first world groups. 

- The rise in methodological critique has both **benefited** and **destroyed** world historical processes (pg 102). It has thus changed how we conduct social sciences and **who** we are allowed to write about. 

- **Geertz and Medick** believed that historians have to decipher others experiences though symbolic and ritualistic acts to discover the persons intentions ( pg 104). 

- **Italian** thinkers felt that it was better to look at history with physical data and then interpret it then the view of the **German** thinkers who instead wanted to interpret information on its own

##  The Annales

-  **Febvre and Bioch** believed that there is no such thing as total history as every part of society is part of history. We can see this develop in modern idea's of history with the rise of histories about the *other* meaning lower classes and other races
## *The Mediterranean*
- The **Three layers Theory** ( 88-89) comprised of 3 different speeds of time ( slow, medium, cast) which correlated with the movement of different histories ( Environment, general population, political) and how they all interacted. more in-depth but complicated views of history

- One Critique that Braudel received was that his three layers theory was not a total history as he had left out major parts of history such as culture, religion and law. These would be important for a total history as these three aspects influence actions that people take

- Another Critique that Braudel received was that he was a Geographical Determinist, meaning that he assumed that all of history was influenced by the geographical aspects. Though geographical aspects should not justify everything in history, it is an important tractor of society that can influence why nations rose and fell ( such as pre historic  Mesopotamia and Egypt)
