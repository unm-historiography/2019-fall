Here are some thoughts on your essays. They are organized more or less by the order of the essays on the nav bar.

Don't feel stuck with this feedback alone. If it doesn't make sense or I didn't address something you have a question about, EMAIL or MAKE AN APPOINTMENT to chat. I'm happy to say more about your essay but you can see that this document is already getting a bit long and taking too long to get back to you.

Your first paragraph says Polybius was "forced" to write about Rome in a certain way--how do we know he didn't genuinely mean what he wrote about Rome? You might also mention he was one of a thousand political "prisoners" who were being forced to live in Rome, making his case less unique (and less restrictive) than it sounds from your intro.

"Though, as a rising historian, you’ll be taught...": I don't think the average reader would consider themselves a rising historian (although hopefully some will!)

"that the most recent way of thinking, in this instance, post-modernism is the correct way it is up to the individual historian to develop their way of thinking, even if it is against the current method": Well, sort of. People who reject convention and methodological standards can struggle to get their voices heard. You have to learn and be willing to play the game even if you want to bend the rules. Exactly what does "in this instance" refer to?

It would be nice to have an introduction to Roman historiography generally and its historiographical interventions. It would be great to have a summary of this even before the biographical details so I can better appreciate Polybius's impact on historiography.

Ah, I see you get to the 1000 people part later. This is a more balanced account.

"The 7th book of the histories is the most important one out of the entire collection as it is the book that encompasses Polybius’s historiographical theories the most. His main ideas contain source analysis, universal history, cycle theory of Rome, and factual integrity of historical writing. " YES! This is what I want to be reading about, but it doesn't seem you elaborate or what these are or how they fit into historiography up to that point.

"many philosophers tried to explain their success and how others failed.": Can you give some examples?

In the first Rome paragraph, can you give specific examples or quotes from Polybius?

"Many Hellenistic philosophers played with the idea of a natural cyclical tend the encompassed the Mediterranean powers allowing them to explain the rise and fall of empires throughout history.": Examples?

The Mixed Constitution section/paragraph is too short to be its own section and I don't understand the historiographical significance.

"Though Polybius never defines practical history within his book, other philosophers had used the concept.": Can you give examples?

If you are quoting from Polybius, make sure to provide first the reference to Polybius's work, then the McGing page where it was quoted. (in other words, cite the primary source first)

Similar to my earlier suggestion that readers would benefit from a summary of what historiography was BEFORE Polyibus, you might also comment more towards the end about his legacy. How were his _Histories_ and ways of writing history used by later historians?

No citations?!?

Coming along nicely, and will be in good shape with some clarifications and more specific examples.

"In many cases in the study of historiography," might be confusing if students are just getting familiar with the concept of historiography. The idea that medieval historians are ignored is less accurate (= wrong) than your clarification that they are seen/characterized as not innovative. Maybe give some specific examples of why this characterization exists.

"That said, it is clearly written and, and was both widely admired and widely copied at the time of its writing. ": Give some indication of how widely copied and thus how influential it might have been.

Before you get into Bede's methodology you should explain expectations of historical writing at the time and/or facets of historical writing that Bede was propagating and subverting. In other words, we need more historical/medieval context.

"The credit for its popularization can without a doubt be given to Bede": be careful with such broad claims. Innovation and popularization are two totally different things. Obv the innovation is important, but one could argue it was the Catholic Church that could take "credit" for the popularization. Oddly, the Church doesn't seem to play much role at all in your essay and influencing ways people thought about time and history.

You really press for the importance of a standardized way of dating stuff, which is fair enough (tho we will always disagree about the significance of this, which is fine). But I'm hoping to see more on the philosophy of history and on the writing of history and the question of how to use history. In other words, more of the course needs to be in your essay. You bring up some of these issues, but I hope you can expand on that aspect of your analysis.


## Jesse
"The Renaissance as a period of time between the 14th and 17th centuries that was marked by a sense of revival and “rebirth”.": typo somewhere in there?

Early quotes are way too long. I'm reading this for YOUR summary and analysis, not for big excerpts of your sources.

Your general organization seems good. But I'd say its quite lacking in any kind of historical detail, particularly humanistic writers who helped shape the direction of historical writing. While you mention the contrast to the Middle Ages, you don't talk about historical writing in that period. (also: Middle Ages is always capitalized.)

Good skeleton here, but you need more historiographical meat on the bones.

Very clear, accessible writing, well organized, and there's definitely a narrative thread that kept me reading along.

Not sure how I feel about the pull quotes next to the images--seems like there's too much competing for visual attention. I do think the quotes are good selections.

Be careful of sounding too idiosyncratic in your first paragraph with the first person. It might be even more compelling to speak about how space REALLY DOES shapes people (not just you) and how it can be examined at different time scales. Embrace your omniscience.

2nd Paragraph: Not bad, but could have a bit more emphasis on large scale (time and space) geography, which is where his primary influence lies. Less so with the quantitative work, which was already underway from the first wave of the _Annales_ school. Relatedly, I think the significance paragraph could/should be much earlier, even before the biography stuff. Readers might be more interested in the bio (= how he came up with his ideas) when after your explanation of how he's reframing time and geography in historical writing.

I think you have a nice balance of detail and big picture once the essay gets going.


## Chloë
"But how did different historians throughout time think of her?": Good question! Can you give us a quick answer in the intro? I struggle to find a clear statement of the historiographical point I should take away.

"They each also have a common story, regardless of the focus of the biography itself: that of Elizabeth’s favorite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. The different approaches to the relationship between Elizabeth and Dudley serve to further articulate the biographers’ own eras of historiography, and for this reason we will examine them as well.": Favorite what? (oh i see you explain that later on but i had no idea) In any case, I think this detail is something to bring in later as it seems to muddy the intro (although it's good to bring it up later b/c it illustrates historiographical convention perhaps)

You have several good quotes and subsequent analysis to show the change in historical treatment, but it seems that only three sample points have limited you to a fairly superficial comparison to illustrate how much "the" history of a person can differ by virtue of the particular historian, their cultural context, and authorial intentions. Besides the few passages, I didn't get an overall impression of what how the authors approached history or what they thought the value of their work was. Obviously professional circumstances matter, too, but I'm not sure how those might factor in your particular authors.

I imagine there have been roughly a zillion books about QEI, so I have to admit I was expecting more of a typology or broader sampling to show historiographical differences and _how QEI literature can teach us about historiography_. I'm not sure what else to take away from your essay than historians have written differently about QEI in 1712, 1896, and 2007, which I would have just assumed to be true because a hundred-plus years in between each one is a long time. If you have just three, they should be closer together, like more or less the 20th century.

Excellent job tying in other essays from the site.


## Marcellina
You have some REALLY long paragraphs that need to be broken up.

The first section on prehistoric medicine is nicely written but it seems very much historical as opposed to historiographical.

Same goes for the second section on Egyptian medicine, and in fact the rest of the essay. You describe medical practice at the time (which is history), but you don't say anything about historiography. You do say: "As alluded to previously, all the papyrus in existence today have given medical historiography much of the foundations in which modern medicine is laid." But you seem to be talking about **medical history** (ie what people knew about medicine in the past and that modern medicine is built on that knowledge) rather than historiography, which would be a study of how historians have written about medical history (which does have it own tradition and has changed profoundly in the last 60 years)

This would be a great essay for a medical history course, but I'm just not seeing the connection to historiography.


## Matthew
"It would also change the way Asian nations view, and study, their own history.": viewed and studied?

Can you put a little more historiographical detail in the first paragraph? It's clear but seems a little too abstract and therefore less effective as a hook. Later on when you get to explaining the historiographical shift, I got a lot more interested in the essay b/c there were more concrete details to grasp onto. Later you have "The ability to incorporate Western Historiography into their own methodology, allowed Japanese historians to create a sense of unique Japanese identity, not burdened by the cultural and historiographical inheritance of China.": something like that closer to the beginning would really help make the significance of your essay clearer.

Your conclusion seems almost entirely historical rather than historiographical. Not that the history you give is irrelevant, but I think it's better to end by hammering home the historiographical significance and relevance of your essay.

I don't have much to say about the rest of it because it's nicely done. Great balance of historical detail and historiographical significance.


## Kyle
You start with "This essay will examine the official historical account of the genocide that occurred in Rwanda, 1994, and aim to compare the similarities and differences of how the history of the genocide is written, portrayed, understood, and perceived today. The reality of ‘what really happened’ and the country’s national history of ‘what really happened’ are far from the same."

Might I suggest something like: "The reality of ‘what really happened’ and a country’s national history of ‘what really happened’ can be far from the same. A perfect example is the case of Rwanda in 1994, when X happened. Now widely recognized as a genocide, this essay compares the the official Rwandan historical account of events of 1994 to how the same events are portrayed and understood today by other historians.

Think more of how much you want to claim that "truth" should be a historians' goal after our many discussions about that. Or at least how it is difficult to ever determine what truth is.

Until the "Partiality" section, I'm having a hard time finding much historiography in here. There seems to be way too much historical detail for the historiographical analysis that you finally get to. But that level of detail should be reserved for your analysis/comparison of historical sources that offer differing accounts, not just historical summary.

From your introduction, I was expecting to see you describe the government's history versus other historical interpretations. Or at least a more explicit walk-thru of different points on which the historical interpretations disagree. The more you can do this in your revisions, the better and more historiographical your essay will be.


## Keena
"Simply, it is that Europe is viewed and has historically viewed itself as the center of the world". A little confusing since Europe cannot view anything. Maybe "western historians have written histories that assume Europe as the center of the world" or something to that effect?

I love the idea of starting with map projections! You could even have a deliberate series of maps to show the "standard" view where NA and Europe look big and centered and mention how this kind of embodies Eurocentrism. Then show the maps you have to ask how this might challenge standard notions of geographic/historical centers.

"Europe is a continent east of the Atlantic Ocean. Geologically, yes, Europe is a continent, but let’s dive into the previous sentence a bit more. “Europe is a continent east of the Atlantic,” why east?": I like the idea behind this sentiment, but you might pick a question where Europe is inherently more central (in your example it's the Atlantic, not Europe, that's central). For instance (don't feel you need to use this one): Where is Russia? Many would answer that it is East of Europe. But why not answer "West of China?" The fact that this sounds a bit weird to us illustrates our Eurocentrism.

The orientation example you give after the images seems a bit repetitive from the first paragraph--or at least I didn't get anything new from it. It seems to get in the way of the important third paragraph that really gets at the significance of the term. It seems a little consolidating could smooth out the first few paragraphs.

"In music, German band, Rammstein’s ...": ???

In your last paragraph, it kinda sounds like it's up to historians to be better about avoiding Eurocentric approaches (agreed), but you've outlined why thinking about the concept cultivates a kind of awareness that could be much more broadly useful for anyone--as all sources of information have a "center" and it's generally useful to think about what that is and how that helps us interpret the source.

Overall, your essay is easy to read, well organized, nicely specific, and thought provoking. Probably the best of the bunch at integrating various course themes into your essay. Beginning needs some ironing I would say, but overall your essay is excellent so far.


## Kate
"Have you ever wondered if time matters when studying history? Maybe you think ‘Of course! History is the study of time,’ but have you asked yourself about whether the perceptions of time mater when studying history? ": this seems repetitive. You could just start with your second paragraph and not lose anything.

"Not only do perceptions of time matter..." Give us more detail on WHY it actually does matter. Then we're motivated to read your particular case studies. How is the value of history going to be different? How might histories be written differently?

"decline or incline": i'm not sure I follow what you mean by this. It probably should be explained in much more detail, but probably not in the introduction.

Image captions tend to be too minimal. These should be used more effectively to make a historiographical point as readers scan through the images and captions.

You do a good job of explaining some concepts of time, but how those concepts factor into the significance of history or the writing of history doesn't seem get covered very well. That's your best opportunity to bring in course material. I'm guessing this stuff is already in your head but hasn't gotten explicitly worked into your essay yet.

I like the broad view you take in the concluding paragraphs, but again, it should be easy to work in more of a historiographical perspective and get at the "what is history for" question--because conceptions of time (and also related notions of progress) play a significant role in answering that question, right?

You mention a few historians, but most of your discussion/analysis seems kind of vague, which makes the whole essay seem more abstract than I think you mean it to be. Do you have any more specific historical examples (books, authors, etc) that you can use to ground your explanations a bit more? I think such additions would really bring some of your larger points home.


## Rick
"Sitting in a classroom, yours eyes glazed over as the teacher drones on with fact after fact is their force-feeding or history.": good idea, needs serious editing.

In your intro be clear about the advantages of historical fiction over other kinds of histories.

Too much bullet pointing in the beginning--although maybe this is just a bit of remaining outlining for you to flesh out. You should explain the significance/interest of the titles you mention.

"We generally understand that history studies the past, but nothing says it needs to be dry and boring (high schoole flashback). Let’s move forward, and look at how history can be inviting and exciting, and the role historical fiction plays in the adventure.": This is repetitive from the introduction.

"In all fairness, the least useful genres, in terms of studying of history, are Fiction, Fictional History, and Alternative History. While interesting, in their own right, they do nothing to expand our understanding of or bring us closer to the historical record. So, let’s move to the other three: narrative history, creative history, and historical fiction.": I have no idea where these categories are coming from or how they can be usefully distinguished from each other. While you _could_ spend a lot of time dividing them up, it doesn't seem to matter for the purpose of your essay. I understand you want to distinguish works that make some effort to reflect the historical record from those that don't care about it, but does it need to be more complicated than that? Resist nuance! There are much bigger fish to fry with your topic.

Your sources should be primarily academic sources that discuss historical fiction or historiographical texts that discuss the nature of historical sources and representation, narrativity, etc. Other web sources are fine as so far as they provide food for thought. You have some good ones, but lots of fluff it seems.

I'm perplexed why there's no discussion of historical truth or objectivity or historical accuracy, etc, even though bring up these before the McCullough collage. I think your essay is a fabulous opportunity to get students thinking about these issues more deeply. Your point seems to be that academic history needs to be more interested (fair enough), but your readers have doing to do with that. They do, however, watch history movies and could probably use help in thinking about their portrayal or use of history more critically.

If you want to talk about narrativity in history, see the work of Hayden White and Alun Munslow. There could be / should be a whole essay on narrativity, but there isn't so it's nice that you're dipping into it here. But don't go too far, as the "story" aspect is common to almost every kind of history you mention here, except the textbook history that you rail against but erroneously label as academic history--these are distinct.

"Clearly, we can’t accept these works as historical ‘gospel.’": Can we accept anything as such? (Besides actual gospel, I mean)

"Integrating works of historical fiction (and creative history) into the academic environment provides a means of drawing more students into the academic study of history.": But aren't you telling us to avoid the academic study of history in favor of something _more interesting_ with a _creative spark_? This kind of statement needs more precision, esp since it doesn't get into the question of "what is history for?". If it's to tell the truth about the past, historical fiction is anathema. If it's to call attention to social inequities (or whatever), then what's the difference?

Is it ever worth discussing what historical recreations/fictions get _wrong_ about history for creative effect? Should authors or directors feel free to alter recorded history because it makes a better story? Is this a violation of some historical fiction rule? Is there a meaningful difference b/w "based on a true story" and "as true a story as we can get"?

You've got a very engaging and accessible style here, but it veers into the campy weeds at times ("Wait, don’t nod off yet!"). Will be excited to see you add more intellectual depth to the many historiographic issues your topic relates to. That depth comes and goes throughout your essay, but in your revisions focus on fleshing out the philosophy aspects as we've done in class.


## Karli
"Through this essay we will compare how the value of oral history has changed over time and how attitudes toward the subject has reformed because of the progress we have had in technology and how that has made oral history be more accessible to common people making oral history important to have so people can connect with history itself.": great example of a run-on sentence (two or three sentences that have been crammed together).

Can you gives us a sense very quickly of how attitudes actually have changed?

In "Oral History and the Change From the Past to Present", you move from describing transmission of oral histories, to recording oral histories, to a Ted Bundy documentary. These are all topics that could be discussed at length in their own paragraphs because of their historiographical significance.

One of the questions you might raise early on is: how do we learn about the past? Written records that don't change over time but might only give an indirect account of events, or someone's memory or story of an event?

Mariner quote is WAY too long.

You have a lot of great ideas in here but I'm not sure you've figured out what you want to say about oral history yet. There doesn't seem to be any coherent thread through the essay.

I think you are conflating two kinds of oral histories. On one hand there are cultures who don't write history or anything down and just pass knowledge orally from one generation to the next. On the other hand, there is the field of oral history which is concerned about learning about the past through people's own historical accounts and using that testimony as historical sources (along with other documents, presumably). There's no hard line between them, but they are really distinct kinds of oral histories but you seem to lump them together or slip from one to the other. I think your essay will be clearer when you more clearly distinguish these throughout the essay. What it means to record an oral history changes depending on which case you're talking about.

"In recent years, the attitudes toward oral history has changed because of the development in technology. ": careful not to ascribe too much agency to the technology. Explain how people are using and/or reacting to technology. Other things have changed in how history is written as well. One important aspect of modern recording technology not explored enough here is how it creates a new kind of historical record and what that might mean for the kind of stories that get told.

The Tupac example should be in a paragraph dedicated to discussing what counts as valuable historical sources and how music might be a kind of oral history, which is an interesting idea yet contrary to what oral histories are taken to be.

Very few citations, and no bibliography = :(

"Your Job as an Oral Historian": I'm a little confused by this ending--why are you presuming that people are going to be oral historians? Is there a broader historical lesson we can take away?


## Corey
"which could make it difficult to find out what actually happened.": is it even possible find out exactly what happened?

"The purpose of this paper is to look at the various authors and source that discuss the battles and discern what actually took place, who was there, and what is/isn’t true.": As a final assignment for a historiography class, I would expect a lot more sophisticated discussion of historical truth rather than a blanket assumption that it exists.

"Another book written by Chun is LUZON 1945": this paragraph is all historical detail and I'm not sure why I'm reading it. What is the historiographical point you're trying to make?

"6 of the 13 books discussed in this essay are written by him.": Since the title of your essay is "WWII portrayed through various historians", I would expect a much wider sampling of authors. The sources you have used are fine for historiographical comparison but they seem rather homogenous. I would expect you to compare them to other authors and particularly different kinds of authors writing different KINDS of histories.

By the end, I see nothing here but summaries of WWII books that don't seem to have any connection to the course. Your introduction and stated goal is sound enough--that you want to look at how historians have written about WWII differently. This is a great topic. But you've just summarized some books on WWII without any of the historiographical analysis.


## Mackenzie
Your first section heading "Why Witches" asks an important question that you don't answer in that section. So, tell us: **What do histories of witches tell us about historiography?**

"These stereotypes are not separated in an academic setting, rather further defined and reasoned with. Raising questions among historians and other philosophers as to why witches are important to a society in the first place?": These two sentences are super confusing.

"and give further reason towards.": ???

I'm having a hard time finding the point of the section labeled "Introduction", since you've already introduce your topic. If it's about historical background, I'm not sure what the point is I'm supposed to take away.

After that, it looks like you're headed in the right direction, but still in process of posting a complete draft.


## Morgan
Be sure you're giving appropriate historical context to "racist" thinking/writing. While there's no question that by our standard Dunning's work could be characterized as racist, it's obvious that what he did was acceptable by the standards/beliefs at his time. It's not really helpful to point out about Dunning: "hey this guy was a flaming racist" because he didn't really stand out as so at the time (tho if someone wrote the same thing now that's exactly what WE'D say). You are trying, it seems to me, to explain HOW what we would NOW see as extreme racism was not only acceptable but influential--but that doesn't seem to be how you're setting it up in the beginning

I think you should start with your second sentence and delete the first. But your intro is so much better than it was.

"The United States works towards": pretty big generalization esp in today's political climate. Maybe something like 'there are always people who are trying to understand the roots of racism to lessen it...' (or something to that effect)

You get into the biography too soon. Spend more time outlining your historiographical point so that readers will be more interested in the personal details. The Dunning's Written Work section is very clear about what he's doing that should be much earlier on. You can give a VERY brief intro to Dunning himself (a professor of X at Columbia). That second P could be about his mentor/advisor in the influences section further down.

"What is unique about the case of William Archibald Dunning, was not his blatant racist views, but rather his “credibility”": But you actually go on to explain how it wasn't really unique at all b/c what he was doing fits in the larger cultural context of justifying what people want to be true about race and asserting fragile claims to power.

Summary paragraph is too long.

I don't think the first 5 or so paragraphs have quite gotten in the right order yet or framed the essay as well as they could, but once it gets going this is a really excellent essay.


## Ben
Even after the intro, I'm immediately confused about how this has anything to do with historiography and the writing of history.

"That is a key fact to know because the Romans would use the Bible to guide a fair amount of their thinking." Like who? Broad claims like this need to have some examples and/or citations.

"They believed this because they took what the Bible said literally.": Um, astronomy and geocentrism didn't start with the Bible and the Roman empire was many centuries old before there was anything called a Bible and everything they knew about astronomy they learned from the Greeks who were advancing theories about astronomy, including geocentrism (by the sixth century BCE at least), for many hundreds of years before anything called Rome ever existed. So no, Romans didn't believe in geocentrism _because_ of the Bible.

Your essay is already going off the rails. Galileo was not the first person to challenge geocentrism--you should be talking about Copernicus.

There is literally an entire genre of historical literature dedicated to the Galileo affair and it does not seem to have informed your essay. You also seem to miss Blackwell's main point (perhaps since it seems you didn't read past page 12) that Galileo got in trouble more for making the pope look like an idiot in his Letters to the Grand Duchess than any heliocentric argument.

"Galileo’s discovery and claims against the literal interpretation of the Bible forced a major shift in the way that Science and the Bible interacted. This interaction is classified as Independence". But in the next paragraph: "Even the authority of the Church got on board with the Independence era. Basil the Great, an influential bishop at the time, dismissed Greek science as ‘idle chatter’ which was ‘not all useful for the edification of the Church’"

I don't follow your logic here: Basil the Great preceded Galileo by over 1000 years--how could he "get on board" with Galileo's ideas?

Furthermore, it wasn't just Galileo arguing against the literal interpretation of the Bible, but also, and crucially, the Protestant Reformation, which doesn't play much role in your essay (and no citations to Harrison's book beyond page 19).

"...there are plenty on both sides of the fence that have problems with the part that humans evolved from monkeys, so that doesn’t factor in this discussion": Why not? That's actually a pretty significant dividing line, so I'm not sure why you can just discard it.

The relationship between science and religion (and where we can find "truth") is indeed fascinating, but this essay, even if it weren't filled with misinformation and dubious claims, has nothing to do with historiography.


## Dustin
This seems to me a medical history essay, or more specifically history of psychiatry essay. I don't really see a historiographical connection--meaning a connection to the topics we've discussed in class in terms of how people are writing history and what they think it is for. All the people you describe are physicians of one kind or another, but these essays are supposed to be about historians or people who have written histories of something or other. If you were to compare and contrast how different historians have written histories of psychiatry (which is easy to do at this point since you've got the background down), that would be historiographical.

The writing and thread of your essay are very easy to follow so it's great you have that so well done already.

As far as you're able to revise your essay, I would focus on analyzing how medical historians over a period of time (say, the 20th century, but it can be whatever you want) have discussed psychiatry in their work and how they ways they've approached the topic have changed over time as per the general trends/changes we've discussed in class. Although I don't know of any specific examples off the top of my head, I would guess most recent history of medicine book/article focused on psychiatry by historians (always be careful of histories written by doctors) will give you some kind of historiographical introduction that will be tremendously valuable in adding in more historiography to your essay.
