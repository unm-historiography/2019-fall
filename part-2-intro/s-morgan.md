## Lemon Part 2 Summary: Analytic Philosophy 

-	The analytic philosophy of history is different from speculative history in that it focuses on the *discipline* of history rather than the *content* **(281)**. Analytic philosophy of history questions the overall design of the study of history, rather than focusing on any one particular methodology or content.

-	Historians must critically asses their work by analytic philosophy standards to become “better” historians **(285)**. A historian is qualified to asses their own work. The “best” historian is a historian who is willing and prepared to critically asses and redefine their own ideas **(288)**.

-	The *theoretical* study of history can be defined as studying history for history’s sake. It revolves around gaining knowledge from a **dis-interested** standpoint **(287)**. The *practical* study of history can be defined as the study of history with the intention to gain information about a topic for personal use. Here a practical historian might use observation to gain insight into a topic for someone’s personal gain **(287)**.
