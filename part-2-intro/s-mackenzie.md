# Analytical Philosophy of History

### What is Analytical History
- Analyzing the **critical thinking** behind the _ways in which historians undertake history_ (pg. 281-282)
- To look at past situations _to understand them and their **potential practical** use for the historian_.
- Similar to historical methodology but asks the questions of **"what the past is"** not **"to what extent the discipline of history makes sense"** (pg. 283)
### Theoretical vs. Practical
- **Theoretical**: understanding solely to understand
- **Practical**: understanding in order to gain something of use in present life
- Example from Lemon: Studying the past events in Ireland _to understand them_ **vs.** _to strengthen a political views or produce a flattering biography_ (of. 286)
### Jean Bodin
- French philosopher, jurist, and political theorist
- _Method for the Easy Comprehension of Histories (1566)_ 
- Suggested that a **good historian** needs to be within a relative timeframe in order to study a history. Being neither _too close_ nor _too far away_.
- Valued **honesty** and **no biases** in historical writings and thoughts. Emphasized **value-judgment** free histories (pg. 284).
