# Summary: Analytical Philosophy

### Approaches

 - History can be studied from a **methodological** perspective or a **philosophical** viewpoint.  That is not to say that the two are mutually exclusive, as the line between them can be blurred.  As with other fields, there are practical applications to theorizing and theoretical uses to practicality in history.  Each has, to varying degrees, critical and technical skills that must be applied.

### Self-Awareness

 - The self-awareness of a historian is central to the process of historical analysis.  In being introspective and aware of their own thought processes historians become more perceptive to to the process and more valuable to the field.  In understanding their **historical methodology** and **analytical philosophy** they develop differing questions relevant to their work.

### Observation

 - Ideally, **Historians are observers** of the world, keeping themselves divorced from a personal interest in what they are observing and the results of those observations.  In doing so, the observer maintains focus on the the objectives of the study.  To this end, there are no ‘_inconvenient truths_.’
