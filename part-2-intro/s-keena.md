# _History is an Activity_

## Methodological v. Analytical

- **Methodology** is the _technical_ analysis of history. (p. 282)
  - Only asks questions _within_ history, does not utilize 'outside' analysis.
  - Focuses on the 'nuts and bolts' that make up history. (p. 284)
- **Analytical** is the _critical_ analysis of history.
  - Incorporates external resources for analysis.
  - Asks why 'nuts and bolts' are used and if something better can replace them. 




## Theoretical v. Practical

- **Theoretical History** is not 'purpose' driven, which allows for **impartiality**, in which the whole of history is analyzed and _observed_. (p. 286)
- **Practical History** _is_ purpose driven and (unintentionally) uses **partiality**, in which only certain "convenient" aspects of history are used. (p. 287)  
- **Observation** separates what is studied from the historians _ideas_ about what is studied.                    


## History Proper

- Self-analysis of one's own thoughts and suppositions is necessary.
- Only 'intellectually adequate' historians are willing to critically analyze their own ideas and change them. (p. 288)
- Only a historian can be a 'doctor' of history, philosophers are "amateurs" and vice versa. (P. 288-289)
