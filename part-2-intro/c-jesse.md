## Summary of Part II Intro
- There are two main approaches to the study of history. One is the analytical and the other is philisophical. The analytical view has become the more popular in recent years and seeks to answer practical questions about history.
- Another key point to the intro is the idea of being a "non-objectice" observer. Looking at history without outside influences will give the most fruitful results to the person observing. 
- The difference between the theoretical and the practical study of history is such. The theoretical study of history looks at history from a completely dis-interested and outside view. Looking to gain knowledge without becoming attached. The practical study of history looks to dive into historical topics with the intention of gaining an answer to a personal or specific question.

# Comments on "History Proper"
- You must self analyze or engage in introspection in order to understand the topics you are studying. Looking to yourself produces a biased opinion?
- This also seems to be the purpose of philisophical history which seems contradicting.
