# Summary: Introduction #

## Analytic v. Methodology ##

Lemon is talking here about the similarities and differences between the analytic philosophy of history and historical methodology. The two are separated, in essence, between *practical* and *theoretical*. Lemon uses a house building metaphor to explain. Methodology, he explains, is like studying the practical aspects of building a house, within the ‘normal’ structures of house-building. Analytic philosophy, on the other hand, questions why we build the house in the first place, what constitutes a house, etc.

## Relevance of Analytic Philosophy ##

Lemon moves on to examine the relevance of the analytic philosophy of history: what purpose does it serve? He makes two arguments in response. The first, a simpler answer, is that: 
>“Historians who are critically aware of the thinking processes they engage in will be that much more thoughtful, perceptive, and confident of the value of what they do, making them ‘better’ historians” (285).

His other argument is more in character due to its long-winded nature. He argues that history is, in essence, a theoretical discipline and that any purely practical study of history is not actually history.

## Foreign territory ##

In his style of almost contradicting himself, but then falling just short of even that, Lemon discusses the separation between analytic philosophy of history and history ‘proper’. The problem is that philosophers are often the ones approaching analytic philosophy of history, rather than historians. This creates skepticism in the minds of historians, who may consider the philosophers ‘amateur’. As Lemon puts it, “Do they *know* what they are trying to talk about?” (289).
