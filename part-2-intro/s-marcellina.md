## *Analytic Philosophy of History* ##

-	Theoretical and Analytical approaches to history are inherently different in their approaches and techniques and each produce different sets of questions. 
	- Analytic History asks the more practical questions and engages more with the question of what Is the discipline of history? Rather than how are we supposed to engage the study of history? 

-	Being a non-objective observer, or theorists rather, gives on the ability to observe history without any outside influences motivating what is studied and what are the outcomes are of what one is studying. 
	- Being a historian that is aware of how they think, what are the methods you are using, as well as reasonings, is necessary to be a successful observer of the past.

-	History is a theoretical discipline. It involves **“critical awareness of the thinking involved”** (288).
    - Therefore, only historians can be considered “doctors” of the discipline or rather the best fit for understanding and most entitled to explain how historians think and approach topics. 



## Chapter 12: The What Is History Debate- Questions ##



 1.	Relating to the types of topics history encompasses and whether or not historians should be able to study anything relating to the past, How different will our understanding of the world be if we were to leave out certain aspects of history? such as societal changes and the more humanistic side of things. 

 2. This chapter delves deep into the idea that although history and historians rely heavily on sources, understanding history should primarily be source based rather than source driven because sources often present biases. If we are to challenge this notion, i.e. make history source driven, what would history be presented like? Would this be considered a flawed view of history? What problems could this lead to down the line for future historians? 

3.	***Narrative and conventional understanding:***  In this section, the author talks about how our ordinary understanding of events or occurrences in history that goes from one event and leads to another, or rather “historical explanation” (315), is an important skill for historians to acquire. It is necessary for them to be able to explain things in a way that is still historically accurate, but also to where everyone can understand it without being too technical. That being said, how important is language as a historian when writing or explaining anything significant or minute in history? Should Historians always have a target audience in mind and keep the rhetoric consistent? 

4.	**Acquiring Knowledge of things Past:** In this section of the chapter, the author talks about how we acquire the knowledge that we have about the past and what can be the problem with using certain sources to understand that past. With that in mind, how are the growing number of sources available now, i.e. technology, going to either complicate this concept further or improve how historians in the future will study and try to understand our history? Will sources become more reliable or will future historians encounter more problems with source reliability than other historians have had to in the past?
