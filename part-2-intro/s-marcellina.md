## *Analytic Philosophy of History* ##

-	Theoretical and Analytical approaches to history are inherently different in their approaches and techniques and each produce different sets of questions. 
	- Analytic History asks the more practical questions and engages more with the question of what Is the discipline of history? Rather than how are we supposed to engage the study of history? 

-	Being a non-objective observer, or theorists rather, gives on the ability to observe history without any outside influences motivating what is studied and what are the outcomes are of what one is studying. 
	- Being a historian that is aware of how they think, what are the methods you are using, as well as reasonings, is necessary to be a successful observer of the past.

-	History is a theoretical discipline. It involves **“critical awareness of the thinking involved”** (288).
    - Therefore, only historians can be considered “doctors” of the discipline or rather the best fit for understanding and most entitled to explain how historians think and approach topics.
