# Summary of Intro Part 2 
- Theoretical and Analytical both have different approaches and the lines can get blurred. Philosophical vs. Understanding. 
- Historians need to remain nonobjective so they have to evaluate why they’re studying history.
- Theoretical and Practical studies- Difference is already knowing what you’re doing and furthering your education, and the other is not knowing what you're doing at all and learning.


# Summary of Chapter 12
### **Theoretical Preliminaries**
##### ***Words and reality*** ##### 
-   What is History?"single out something in the world out there"(199) 

##### ***The Word History*** #####
- Humans like to distinguish activities and the word *History* is the activity of studying the past. 

##### ***History as the study of the past*** #####
-   Defining history is hard because there is two separate definitions that people argue over. Whether history is the study of what happened, or the study of what was said about the past.
-   Natural History and History became two different subjects.
-   Both natural and (human) history discusses the "notion of change"(199).

##### ***Types of History*** #####
1. Descriptive History
2. Analytical History
3. Narrative History 
 
### **The epistemological status of History**
-   "Status of Knowledge"(301) and the "credibility of truth"(301).
##### ***Acquiring knowledge of things past*** #####
-   We can't see what happened in the past.
-   we can be told about history, or watch/listen about history, but soesnt mean this is how history actually happened. We need evidence and evidence could be tricky because of the lack of inerence and truth. Truth is evidences scan be hard because sources can be hard to find that provide absolute truth. 
-   Written sources are limited because things in history were only written when they wanted us to know something, and sometimes it's not the absolute "whole story". They can also be biased because of who wrote them.  
-   "Historical knowledge is limited to the sources that are available"(305). 
##### ***Historical Explanation*** #####
Ways to approach Scientific explanations:
1. Scientific Causality
2. Covering-law Models
3. Explaining Things
4. Historical Accounts
5. Narrative
