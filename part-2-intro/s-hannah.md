# Part 2: Introduction to the Analytic Philosophy of History

## Analytic Philosophy
-**Lemon** states that on page **281-282**,  that analytic philosophy is the practice of questioning the history of history as a discipline. It is the way of questioning about how history is studied and now how history should be viewed. This is done through general and abstract questions. Esencually, the different between **methodology** and **Philosophy** is by studying history through its technical aspects ( such as procedures) and its critical aspects ( why events happened). Lemon explains this point further through his house building metaphor on page **282** 

##  Building houses, Historical Methodology and Analytic Philosophy 
**Lemon** helps explain the difference between **Historical Methodology** and **Analytic Philosophy** by explaining the questions each type of history would ask when it came to **house building** ( house building analogy pg 282 kindle version) . A Historical methodologist would be more concerned about the **builders and the materials** which can be seen as more material objects. This can also be seen as questioning the **surface level** of a history while analytic philosophy would ask deeper questions. An analytic philosophy would question socially accepted ideas that don't necessarily have straight answers but answers that can change over time and space. 

## Observation
According to Lemon an observer is not 

> involved in what one is observing. Neither does it affect oneâ€™s interests what understanding one gains of the event (pg 286)

A **practical study** is the practice of only studying the parts that care concerned with the objective of the study. For instance, academic argument essays only care for facts and knowledge that supports the argument ( not including counter claims). This is widely different from **theoretical studies** where it is concerned with learning all aspects of the study and does not take a side. Meaning, practical studies collect facts for an argument while theoretical collects facts in order to understand a whole picture.
