## Summary: Analytical Philosophy of History 

- Analytical philosophers of history are focused not only on general questions but on more analytical questions that focus on what history could or should be. 

- One can study history practically or theoretically (analytical). However, the lines blur because of the similarity of questions asked but differ in the scope that they cover. 

- Analytical philosophers of history need to be aware of their own thinking and be conscious of the fact that it is foreign territory because, as Lemon states, "analytic philosophers of history are not, in the main, historians; they are philosophers"(pg. 471).

## The "What is History" Debate

First off, I feel that this chapter is the most philosophical one we have read. Lemon is asking questions like "What is a historian?' or "What does a historian do?". __Language__, as Lemon describes, is important when constituting what a historian asks and what exactly he or she is trying to find through the study of history. 

### Types of History 

There are __three types of history; these are descriptive, analytic, and narrative__. When writing about analytical history, Lemon states that it is "to go beyond describing it. It is to 'explain' it" (pg. 444). I found this to be interesting because, as a student studying history, it has always been my belief that while writing history, we are explaining history.  This made me question who I am as a historian and made me think of the questions I should be asking. Like have I been merely describing history or have I been analyzing it. 

### Evidence, inference, and facts.

In this section, Lemon talks about producing and the producers of things like videos and pictures, giving new insight and questions into whether or not these are reliable sources. I have never thought of questioning videos and or pictures, but Lemon proves that we need to question these things while also recognizing the historical importance that they hold. In class, we have already talked about the bias of written history, but do you think that pictures or videos have more validity than written history? 
In my opinion, they are both the same because, as Lemon points out, "most film and sound material is also edited after the event" (pg. 494). All sources in history are biased in various ways. 

### Explaining History

Explaining history is important, and the techniques used should be ones that answer questions asked by a historian but also help present the information in a particular way. One could write the 'cause' and 'effect' however; this could only answer some questions. Does it matter the way in which someone explains history if one is not asking questions? 

### Historical topics

Everything has a history so we should study anything and everything. At the same time, realize that there are different histories, and Lemon addresses this when talking about natural history. We consider that more of a science today; however, it is still a history. Whether it is worth studying, that is __subjective__. I think it is also influenced by the academic community itself and what academia deems as worthy of study.
