Summary

•	The chapter opens with an introduction to historical views and relations with the Middle Ages. The majority of people had their eyes turned ‘heavenward’ and had little interest in new historical findings or facts. Things would change little (Beyond intellectuals) until the 15th Century ‘humanist’ scholars began to spread the new ‘Renaissance’ teachings.

•	Humanist scholars sell the idea of Antiquity being an age of light followed by ‘Dark Ages’ followed by their period of a new light calling back to Antiquity. Their callbacks to an older era helped ‘turn men’s eyes from Heaven back to Earth’. People began to care more about history, culture, life, language, etc. This ‘turn towards Earth’ also plants the seeds of secularism.

•	A new awareness of society and cultures, cultural relativism, during the Renaissance was a major factor in shifting perspective on time and history brought about by expanding economies and expanding geographical knowledge. The Printing Press impounded on these and helped facilitate a flow of information. We are reminded that many of these changes were of two steps forward one step back, such as mass censorship and propaganda following the printing press, or slave trade increasing with discovery of new lands.

•	The alterations of people’s mindsets take a significantly longer time than many tend to think, an example being people’s perceptions of time and history. 

•	Chronological markers of history have been debated, created, and dissolved over recent years. Movements, ages, Epochs, etc., may do damage or cause confusion, or represent very vague ideas, but would cause likely conflict and more confusion by their sudden dismissal. People’s perceptions about the past are slow to change as stated earlier, and this subject exemplifies it.

•	More’s Utopia is highlighted to show the attempt to make people think both of their future history and rethink their past history as something less mythical or more important than random facts. 

•	We next touch on Machiavelli as one who studied and wrote of history. He questioned the meaning of history and wanted others to learn of and from history in service to his goal of stronger and ‘better’ governments being formed. Machiavelli talks about opening a new path and perusing the ‘wonderful examples’ of history. 

•	Machiavelli’s has musings on cultural relativism where people’s disregard of alien cultures or histories stems from either a sense that what they learn of is of no significance to their own lives and are merely wonders or curiosities or of a sense that the differences in history or culture is so vast that they cannot learn from it.

•	Part of the closing on Machiavelli is his thoughts on ‘fortune’ and its effects on mankind and history. The idea is presented that an almost uncontrollable ‘force’, that is Fortune, has great guidance on the direction of major historical events, but that mankind, by learning and improving on themselves from the past, can alleviate the power Fortune holds sway over.
