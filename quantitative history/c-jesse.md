## Quantitative History vs. Regular History
- Quantitative history, as stated in the Green reading is a relatively new practice. The methods of quantitative history have only been developed within the last 250 years or so. That being said, quantitative history has allowed the academic world of history to progress in ways it never would have without these methods. The ability to look at a census report from 1850 and deduct a change in economic or social pracitces from the time due to the wealth or the property ownership of a group of people was not happening before quantitative history began. 
- Like I said before, Quantitative history is a relatively new method. This means that it has immense room to grow. We have only scratched the surface of what is possible with quanitative history, especially with regards to computerized quanitative history. These methods have changed the ways that we interact with history and access sources. Computerized methods will allow easier and more efficient interaction with sources and data. 
- I think that Quantitative history is different from regular history but also complementary. Quantitative history pushes regular history to be more understood than ever before. 
- I would not be suprised to see all hisotry within the next 100 years be completely computerized and to some degree "quantitative". However, the need to engage with sources in "regular" historical methods will hopefully persist into the next generation.
