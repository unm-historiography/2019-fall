# Quantitative History

While I am a “numbers person,” particularly with regard to athletic performance, thus seeing the efficacy of the use of data to better understand the world around us, to claim that “data” is or will be the overarching theme of post-modern historiography lacks a greater understanding and appreciation for the critical analysis of qualitative historical resources.  While increasing the amount of data at the historian’s disposal, it is not a replacement for “_thoughtful interpretive practice._”[1]

### The Birth of “Big Data”

Some historians would argue that the historical application of quantifiable data came with the birth (1930’s) or advancement (1960’s) of computers.  Others would cite census (and economic) data,[2] particularly data beginning in the 1890’s, as seminal in the historical application of quantitative data to historical analysis.  In defense of this latter position, [Frederick Jackson Turner’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Jackson_Turner) use of 1890 census data was, by many accounts, the first late-scale application of collected data and served as the basis for his paper “[The Significance of the Frontier in  American History.”](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/historical-archives/the-significance-of-the-frontier-in-american-history)[3]  Before Turner, [Thomas Malthus’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus) essay on population history (1798) and economic history[4] made ample use of economic and demographic data expanded the study of “the mass of people in the past.”  

### Clio-What?

With the advancement of computing power, initially with punch-card readers and later with digital computing, economists latched on to these tools to gain a greater understanding and, more poignantly, ‘chew through’ ever increasing amounts of numerical data to better model the world through economic data.  This gave rise to cliometrics, or econometrics.  There are four practices that characterized:[5]

1. State precisely the questions subject to examination and to define operationally relevant variables
2. Build explicit models that are relevant to the questions at hand
3. Produce evidence…of the world as it actually existed
4. Test the model…against the evidence…and the counterfactual deduction.

### The Assumptions

Economist work on **two foundational assumptions**:[6]

 - Humans behave in an economically rational way, and

 -  That there are no exogenous variables.

These assumptions are clearly impractical.  There is always the unanticipated variable, or ‘[**black swan**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)’,[7] that cannot be accounted for nor anticipated.  Economic historians understand the sometime profound influences of just such events, holding to the axiom that “**history is not well-served by economic models**,”[8] and “that each historical situation is unique.”[9]. There is the belief that “cultural factors are less important than economics” as historical determinants.[10]. Further still, there are some that suggest “demography [is] the determinant of social and economic life.”[11]

### Final Thoughts

Going back to my initial remarks, the use of data can provide a wealth of foundational information and understanding to our study of history, but it is the synthesis of this data with qualitative sources that gives context to history.  Without application of critical analysis and synthetic practices numbers are little more than scribbles on a page or bits in a computer.  History is human in its origin and outcomes.  Numerical information can add greater understanding to our pasts and futures, but it is not the central ‘figure’ to their evolutions.
