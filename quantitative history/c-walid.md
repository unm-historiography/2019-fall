   **Is quantitative history fundamentally different from ‘regular’ history?**
   What can we really call 'regular' history? If quantitative history is a part of 'regular' history its probably incorrect to make
   any assumptions that it is fundamentally different. All history revolves around the analysis of various sources and the inferences
   that we can make based on that analysis, quantitative history seems to be more about fleshing out the mathematical aspect of the 
   analysis (Something that occurs at some level regardless if we graph it or put it in a comparative table) rather than some completely
   new idea. Quantitative history is just another way to sort and contrast data that is already being analyzed in a fashion that
   'better' breaks down the data for consumption and further analysis.
   
   
   
   **To what extent will all history gradually become quantitative history (as sources are born-digital or become digitized)?**
   I don't think it'll become quantitative history, rather, we will include more quantitative proofs to make more informed inferences 
   and statements about history. As digital sources and information increase there can be a natural assumption that more quantitative
   studies will take place to utilize said digitized data, that being said it would also be equally fair to say that greater access
   to information will increase qualitative studies as well. I suppose we'd have to do a quantiative study to be sure!
