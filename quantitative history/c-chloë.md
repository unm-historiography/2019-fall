## Is quantitative history fundamentally different from ‘regular’ history? ##

### Nope. ###
Quantitative history, although different in its approach to the past, ultimately asks many of the same questions, and is, therefore, looking for similar kinds of answers, to regular history. There are obviously different processes and outputs though, making it somewhat of its own field. I’d personally compare it to different types of psychological studies. Traditional history is more like a *case study*, where descriptive research techniques are used to examine the context of a specific individual, or maybe [naturalistic observation](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-naturalistic-observation-2795391). Quantitative history is more like a [correlational](https://www.simplypsychology.org/correlation.html) or [self-reporting method](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/self-report-method), which is part of what Anderson suggests quantitative historians were modeling. Both work together in the same field and are merely different approaches, just like other social sciences, which also have to take **multiple types of observation** into account.

## To what extent will all history gradually become quantitative history (as sources are born-digital or become digitized)? ##

### It's complicated? ###
It is short-sighted to think that any of us, with our limited perspectives, could fully answer this question. However, given that I’m human and therefore presumptuous, I have an opinion anyway. I don’t find it possible that as a global community, we will fully put aside the traditional study of history. This is because of the sheer scale of it. The way we primarily study history now can come from amateurs with little to no training. It can take the form of family stories, personal narratives, inside jokes, and community lore. Granted, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible that **accurate** qualitative history will survive. I’ve ‘known’ since the age of 8 that there was a young girl named Lucy who died in my elementary school from a bad fall, and that she haunts the basement to this day. However, a quick jaunt through the Webster-Kirkwood times archives in high school revealed no such event.
