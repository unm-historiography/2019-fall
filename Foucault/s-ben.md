### Introduction

-	_traditional analysis_ is the tool that enables historians to carry out the work of analysis. This is linking multiple events together into a linear plane.  
-	Move away from _Uniting_  periods or centuries is putting a whole time period together and summarizing it into a singular narrative to _ruptures of discontinuity_. Looking at events in by themselves and not another chapter in the cycle of the story. 
-	 _epistemological acts and thresholds_ by **Bachelard**. Steps away from the progressive accumulation of knowledge.
-	_displacements and transformations_ by **G. Canguilhern**. Continued disproving of knowledge acquisition as progressive and linear. Each situation is different and can’t be described in same, general way. 
-	_architectonic unites_ by **M. Gueroult**. Looking more inward at occurrences for compatibilities rather than describing culture or influences. 
-	Great problem looking at historical analysis is division or limits. It rebuilds the foundations that have been set fourth before and continue to be used. It is this want to place history into a **stable structure**. 
-	When looking at a **document** history has wanted to reconstitute it to understand what it is trying to prove happened, what men have said and done. Must not look unify the document with the rest of the narrative. 
-	 Turn moments into documents to be placed in group to be placed in total history.

##### Consequences
-	First, define elements to each other on the linear timeline that fits into the boundaries. 
-	Second, discontinuity has been meant to be removed from a historian’s timeline. Historians trained to make discontinuity disappear. 
-	Third, a total history or description revolves around a singular meaning or principle while general history shows dispersion of non-related events.
-	Fourth, methodological problems that are too focuses on determining groups. 
-	Define a method of historical analysis that isn’t restricted to anthropological themes. Not having to define everything within the normal human cycle of progress. 

### Chapter 1

-	Get rid of the conceptual structure of continuity 
-	_Oeuvre_ is a collection of work contributed to a single author. All of the works at united on some level. Need to be aware of possible continuity, but doesn’t necessarily constitute a negative. Searching for continuity is a project of _pure description of discursive events_. 

### Chapter 2
-	First hypothesis. Statements different in form, throughout time, form a group that refers to one object. Foucault gives the example of a madman and how while the original meaning of madmen isn’t the same today as it was, but it is still refers to the same object. 
-	This is where things got confusing.
-	Second hypothesis. More to do with style and looking at things the same way. Taking the same approach in medicine. 
-	Third hypothesis. Establish groups by using the permanent and coherent concepts. The concept of a word is a single representation. 
-	Fourth hypothesis.  Regroup the statement and describe their interconnections. It is open to political manipulation.
