# Summary
## Part 1 
- Disciplines called *the history of ideas* do not follow the methods a historian should use. Instead of focusing on periods of time they focus on discontinuity (5).
- **History of a concept**- Development of a method. 
    - Recurrent Redistributions (5) - History is depicted only by what the person writing it knows. He cannot write the whole depiction correctly if he doesn’t have full understanding of what’s going on around him. 
  - The past as ideological
  - *Architectonic unities*
     -  Problem: no longer tradition. History analysis starts transforming. 
     -  Idea of long periods of history 
-  *Total History Vs. General History* (9)
      - Total history begins to disappear (9), and general history emerges. 
## Unities of Discourse
- Traditions
    - to be able to link events and create unity (22). 
    - analyze the themes instead of the period of time. 
## Discursive Formations

1. Meanings change over time. 
2. Find something in common
3. "Establish groups of statements"(34) by looking at concepts that are common. 
4. Regroup and connect (35).
