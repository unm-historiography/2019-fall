# What did I Just Read? #
### My poorly written summary of Foucault’s Main Points ### 

# Introduction #
-	The methods and approaches that historians use to tell a broader history is ever changing as different approaches are used and applied. 
-	**Recurrent Redistribution** depends on the *present state of knowledge*. The past and its connections etc. are categorized by this present knowledge. 
-	**Architectonic Unities** as described by M. Guerolt as being more concerned with understanding from within, accepted truths, inferred connections, and compatibilities(**pg.5**)
-	History is messy and has a constant change within the discipline. 
    * In its’ *traditional form*, historians would use decipher the past and the evidences left behind by man and decipher them and find a way to group these evidences together to make a totality view if history that makes sense. 
-	**Discontinuity** has become one of the basic elements of historical analysis (**pg.8**). 
    * Discontinuity serves as a paradoxical method for it allows the historian to individualize certain aspects but in order to individualize it, they have to be compared. *
-	Consequence of this: ***Total history*** begins to disappear while ***general history*** begins to emerge. 
    * The articulation of history as divided into units (stages or phases) is challenged by this new history 
-	This new history has freed itself from what constituted the philosophy of history and the questions that philosophy posed. 
-	Intersects with problems seen within other fields and thus can be labeled as *structuralism*. 

 ### Part II: The Discursive Regularities ###
-	**Notions:** historians must rid themselves of it which will inherently diversify the concept of continuity. 
    * They do not have a precise conceptual structure, but notions serve a very precise function (pg.21). 
-	How one views a document and an author can change the view of history.
    * Looking at a document and what it says versus looking at the author (the person behind the text). 
-  **What should be considered when looking at a historical text?** 
-	Pre-existing forms of continuity, ideas and concepts that are accepted without question must be held in suspense. 
    * They don’t necessarily need to be rejected outright, but one must remain critical of the notions that allow them to be accepted and come about. 
-	***“Once these immediate forms of continuity are suspended, an entire field is set free”*** (pg. 26). 

## Hypotheses ##

1.	Statements that are at the offset different in form, will eventually mesh together into one group if they refer to the same object.  
2.	Determining a group of statements and determining their relationship to one another. 
3.	Concepts as a tool for determining groups of statements and where they fit categorically
4.	Regroup those statements into a category that interconnects with one another.
