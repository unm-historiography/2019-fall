 # Summary: Foucault

### Introduction

 - [Paul-Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault) presents a shift in analytical thought, a transition from a connective to a stratified nature of historical analysis (3-4).  In this Foucault dismantle the ‘singlularly connective nature’ of history and parts a vision of what has become to be called ‘network theory analysis.’  Taking this idea even further, he debates the utility of ’schools’ of analysis and philosophy (5), even going so far as to argue the very nature of science, theory, concept, and even text. (5)

 - Foucault states that questioning the nature of document analysis—truth versus expressive (6)—needs to be taken from the constituent level to a more wholistic interpretation, moving to a view that **all** historical sources are inextricably linked.  The more contemporaneous the sources the stronger the connection.  What needs to be understood is the nature of the relationships between these separate elements.

Four problems he expresses in his conversation center on:

  1. “The proliferation of discontinuities in the history of ideas, and the emergence of long periods of history” centered on “causality, circular determination, anatagonism, and expression.” (7)

  2. The major role discontinuity plays in the study of history—“decisions, accidents, initiatives, discoveries”.  The analytical rearrangement, reduction, effacement of material for the purpose of constructing ‘continuity.’ (8)

  3. The disappearance of _total history_ and the emergence of _general history_. (9)

  4. The methodological concerns surrounding the _new history_, while not originating with it but characterized it (10-11)

     - the build-up of coherent and homogeneous body, or _corpora_, of documents,
     - the establishment of a principle of choice,
     - the definition of the **level of analysis** and relevant elements,
     - the specification of a method of analysis,
     - the  delimitation of groups and sub-groups that articulate material,
     - the determination of relations that make it possible to characterize a group, and
     - the relation of the ‘signifier’ to the ‘signified.’

He argues that methodology has evolved to become separate from the philosophy of history and the underlying questions posed by the philosophy. (11)  Continuing, Foucault interjects additional issues with the structuralism of methodology (e.g. linguistics, economics, methodology, literary analysis). (11)

### The Unities of Discourse

  - The diversified themes of continuity must be exorcised, eliminating tradition, influence, development and evolution, and ‘spirit.’ (21-22), dismantling the “ready-made syntheses” that create the forces linking discourse between people, and viewing the source materials as a ‘dispersed population.’ (22)

 - Books and text are impediments to greater understanding, in Foucault’s view.  The very nature of books, and the relational nature of one to another (or lack thereof), diminishes their utility.  The structuralism of linguistics limits their functionality and originality. (23-24)

### Discursive Formations

  - The very nature of analysis makes comparative discourse moot in the mind of Foucault.  By denying the structuralism of categorization, Foucault argues that any attempt at comparative discourse denies the fact that “statements are different in form, and dispersed in time.” (32).  Foucault’s disunity of discourse is a “discourse, concerning madness,” (32) one whose rules are transformative of objects; (33) this definition is, in itself, a maddening prospect.  To Foucault, analysis is transformative, altering meanings and perceptions of the discourse, and as such the very nature of the object of the discourse.

 - Any lack of rigidity—the availability of nuance or flexibility—makes any such field controversial, such as economics science.  With this he argues both for and against structuralism.

### Conclusion

Foucault’s argument isn’t attempting to redefine the nature of history and the means of its analysis, but rather the nature of the conversation surrounding it, to increase the awareness of what is being said and how it is said, and does so with a sense of detached (and French?) humor.  He defines the interdependence of contemporary methodologies, books, and structuralism.  His ultimate supposition lies in the premise that power is knowledge, knowledge is power and that human history is grounded in knowledge and human existence.

In the end, his arguments are reminiscent of Lemon’s, but Foucault leads the reader down a very different path, one that eschews everything that historians (and other academics) have come to know and embrace.  Lemon, to the contrary, encourages introspection and self-illumination by providing enough history and information to spawn further questions, in the same way he poses questions to the reader; a maddening trait in its own right.
