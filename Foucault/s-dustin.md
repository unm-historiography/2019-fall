# Foucault, Archeology of Knowledge
**Intro**
Interpretation, history of “thought, knowledge, philosophy, literature seem to be seeking, and discovering more and more discontinuities, whereas history itself seems to be abandoning the irruption of events in favor of stable structures.” (p.6) So basically historians *document* history in a fashion that does not convey truth of event, but provides a solid foundation for the desired economic and political platforms to remain stable upon. 

These problems might be summed up in one word, “the questioning of the *document*” used to record history, but do they convey ‘truth’? 

Memory: provides societies with interlinked mass documentation. 

The discontinuities of *history proper*

Total History begins to fade, while an emergence of a General History takes hold
These types of problems are for the *methodological field of history* Linguistics, ethnology, economics etc. 
“A history that would not be division but development” (p.13). The theme of historical continuity had been revitalized. 
Foucault’s aim is to “uncover the principles and consequences of an autochthonous transformation taking place in the field of historical knowledge” (p.15). 

**Part II**
Question of procedure & Theoretical problems
“We must also question those divisions or groupings with which we have become so familiar” (p.22). So, any knowledge we have of things being separated or connected must be put inot question? Great!
All events have a beginning, but, they all have *secret origins* so “secret that the events can never be quite grasped” (p.25). So historical discourse will only ever convey a fraction of the true happenings? 
“all these syntheses that are accepted without question, must remain in suspense” (p.25) Yes, question everything we know, but without totally rejecting what we *know* to be true. 
What was being said in what was said? “we must grasp the statement in the exact specificity of its occurrence” (p.28). Undoubtedly understanding the linguistic origin is vital to conveying true historical synthesis. 

**Chapter 2**
“What are medicine, grammar, or political economy” (p.31)? Are they simply grouping things together in order to deceive themselves of their own past? 

**Hypothesis** 

-Statements different in from, and dispersed in time, form a group if they refer to one and the same object. No matter the discourse, it will find relation of some common core topic/field-of-study, and be *grouped* under the same banner. 

-To define a group of relations between statements. All connected by their specific *style*

-Might it not be possible to establish groups of statements, by determining the system of permanent and coherent concepts involved? Things that are established “once and for all” (p.34). 

-To regroup statements, describe their relations and account for their presented unity. The identity and persistence of themes.
