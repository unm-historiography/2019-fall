# _Archeology of Knowledge_

## Introduction

**Shifts in Focus** (pgs. 3-5)
- Away from periodization
- Differences between macro and micro analysis
- Discontinuity as an issue
- History of ideas, rather than events
- History is living and _continuous_

**The _Document_** (pgs. 6-7)
- Focus no longer on 'truth' or accuracy of historical documents
- Significance of humans documenting 'memories' as a universality to better understand human thought

**Four Consequences** (pgs. 8-12)

**1** Chronology stratified through memory, telling, retelling, and revision

**2** Discontinuity
- Events 'removed' from history by historians
- Use of most convenient periodization
- Creates arbitrary boundaries on a continuous past
- Final product becomes part of assumed reality among historians

**3** General History replaces Total Histories
- Does not aim to create a pluralistic history
- Tries to understand the time _between_ events and its significance over major historical events

**4** Difficult to establish a homogeneous and coherent history
- Principle of Choice - level of analysis of documents
- Determining relevance of documents
- Methodologies
- Delimitation
- Significance of relationship between historian and subject


## The Unities of Discourse

- Historians must erase their beliefs about the past in order to truly understand and study it (21)
-- including ideas of tradition, permanence, and unity 
- Books and oeuvres (collection of work by one author) are no more reliable than any other documents (23)
- What is not said in historical texts is _as important_ as what is said (25)
- Studying beyond 'facts' (27)
-- intention of author
-- conscious **and** unconscious activity of author
-- what is the author _not_ saying and why?
- **History will be _set free_ through delimitation**
-- historians' decisions will be more 'controlled' and less arbitrary


## Discursive Formations

**Four Hypotheses on the Grouping of Statements**

**1** Statements which are different but refer to the same object form a **group** (32)
- Multiple, varying statements over time determine what something _is_ 

**2** A group of statements is determined by their form and connection (33)
- 'style' in which they are said and relationship to other statements said in a similar style

**3** If there is no such thing as a 'concrete/coherent' statement, then it may be impossible to form groups (34)
- abstract words/concepts interpreted differently by all individuals

**4** In order to regroup statements, their 'identities' must have remained constant throughout history (35)
- Is 'science' today the same 'science' as the past?
- are we _really_ talking about the same ideas?


- What groups statements together is not what makes them independently coherent (36)
-- all statements require individual temporal/spatial/historical context
- Future historians should strive towards **discursive formations** (38)
-- avoidance of weighty, abstract, and easily misinterpreted words
