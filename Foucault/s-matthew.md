## Summary for _Archeology of Knowledge_ Readings

### Introduction
#### The _Continuous_ to the _Discontinuous_
- Historians have created tools to allow them to find continuity and broad rhythms in the seemingly discontinous fluctiations of the past, though these methods have more recently come into question. (p.3-4)
- Conversely, the **history of ideas** embraces the discontinuity, and focuses on concepts such the _threshold_, _transformation_, _mutation_, _rupture_, and _break_ of concepts. (p.4-5)
#### _Monuments_ into _Documents_ 
- History is based on the **document**, and the questioning and interpretation of those documents have now given way to a structuring of the document from the inside out. (p.6-7)
- Historians also take **monuments**, or objects, and convert them into documents, by attributing an unspoken meaning to them.  This method is now being used on documents. (p.7)
#### Four Consequences of History as Archeology
1. Proliferation of the discontiuous history of ideas, and the re-emergence of long periods of history proper. (p.7-8)
2. The increased importance of **Discontinuity** in historical fields, where it has become key in analysis. (p.8-9)
3.  **total history** gives way to **general history**, and the singular center of history dissapears. (p.9-10)
4.  Problems of **methodology**, particularly how do to interact and make use of documents, has now come to define this *new history*. (p.10-11)
#### What this Book is **NOT**
- An attempt to impose **structuralist** methods on the history of ideas. (p.15)
#### What this Book **IS**
- A forumulation of historical tools constructed in the study of the history of ideas. (p.16)
- A use of structuarlism to ask questions. (p.16)
### Chapter 1: The Unities of Discourse
#### "a whole mass of notions"
- In order to properly engage with later concepts in the book, there many **unities**, such as concepts of tradition, influence, development, and evolution, which must be questioned. (p.21-22)
- Certain **divisions** must also be questioned, such of the seperation of types of discourse (science vs. history vs. philosophy, etc.) (p.22)
#### "the book and the _oeuvre_"
- Foucault uses a book as an example of how the basic questioning such unities destroys an object's self evident appearance, thus requiring complex discourse. (p.23)
- He also deconstructs the concept of the **oeuvre** of a writer.  Something which, once the complexity of all texts and non-texts are taken into accounty, lacks unity. (p.24)
#### Precautionary Renunciation
- Two historiographical concepts, the **secret origin**, in which there is always an unknown cause for an event, which will cause the historian to forever look deeper and deeper into the past for answers, and the **already said**, in which we ignore what has already been studies, must be reounced, in order to receive the discourse of interruption. (p.25)
#### Not So Fast...
- Unities do not need to be despensed with entirely, but can be used as starting points, in order to ask deeper questions.  Groupings are allowed to remain, or be replaced if necessary. (p.26)
#### 'great accidents that create cracks'
- By disregarding all constictive unities, we are able to view moments of **historical interruption** with better clairity.  When not bound by traditional concepts of **significance**, new concepts emerge.  (p.28)
