### Foucault’s Four Main Points
###### (As I poorly interpreted them)
-	History and the study of history, is messy. When we deeply analysis history we find “discontinuities” and too many conflicting factors that makes the reliable creation of history impossible. Historians should never strive to construct “total” histories because it is an impossible task **(7)**.

-	Historians used to find these “discontinuities” and find ways to “fix” or “reason” the “discontinuities” away. However, Historians actually need to be actively looking for the “discontinuities” as their analysis adds to the credibility of the history being written **(8)**.

-	When we discuss “general history” we try to find similarities between “this history” and “that history”. We need to not ask ourselves “what is similar” but parameters are we using to define “similar”. What do our choices of parameters say about the selection of facts we use to write out “general” histories about **(9)**?

-	There is a build-up of information because Historians value *everything* about a concept. This build-up of information is not meaningful and only confuses the Historians must pick and choose what information is valuable to them. We must not look at these documents as explaining concepts of the time but to explain the literal documents themselves **(10)**.
