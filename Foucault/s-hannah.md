# Foucault's Ideas Summarized.

## Readers Note
Before reading, I would like to have a personal apology to anyone reading my work. I have been very sick and I have tried my best to understand Foucault's work. Under normal circumstances I would have still struggled but you get the opportunity to experience my lack of complex thinking and understanding while sick. Forgive me for most of this will probably be very wrong. 

## Introduction
- In the beginning of the chapter, Foucault expresses the changing of history along with other disciplines and how the view of not only history but the interactions of the knowledge change. He explains these though **Epistemological acts and thresholds**. These thresholds ( from the best of my understanding) is the action of historians changing the boundaries in which events fall into and the explanation of this events are always changing depending on how the information is used. 
- **Recurrent Distributions** also follow this idea that information is being *categorized* by historians depending on the concepts *evaluated* both of which are dependent on the historian at a single moment.  
- Foucault summarizes his early ideas with the following quote: 
 

> In short, the history of thought, of knowledge, of philosophy, of
> literature seems to be seeking, and discovering, more and more
> discontinuities, whereas history itself appears to be abandoning the irruption of events in favour of stable structures. ( pg 6)

### Document 
- Foucault makes a clear distinction of historical disciplines through the interaction of documents. It comes down to if a historian interacts with only the **information** of a document or with the **author** as well. 
- He also answers this question within the same paragraph ( pg 6) saying that the *relation of the document to history* is more important then the **document** itself. 
- Once again these idea's can be summarized in this quote 

> To be brief, then, let us say that history, in its traditional form,
> undertook to 'memorize' the monuments of the past, transform them into documents, and lend speech to those traces which, in themselves, are  often not verbal, or which say in silence something other than what they actually say; in our time, history is that which transforms documents into monuments. ( pg. 7)

## Four Consequences of Historical Discourse
1. This causes the loss of structure for history as it previously was connecting events to causation.
2. An increase focused on the historian themselves and not of their work
3. the shift from total history to general history due to the lack of structure. 
4. running into methodological problems when stabilizing this new history. 

## Methodological Field of History
- New history is attempting to differentiate itself from the questions, knowledge of  previous versions of history
- this new history is also experiencing the same problems as seen in other fields of study 
- Continued history can fall into the belief that lost history can be returned and recovered and thus putting more emphasis on human consciousness. 

## Chapter 2
- History continues to run into patterns of repetition as well as the notion of spirit. 
- Foucault mentions a lot within this chapter about how language also changes how history is studied and, if not acknowledged, can lead to a variety of different conclusions. 
- An example of this can be suicide as seen though American and Japanese understanding of it. 
### Never a Beginning
- With the rise of the ideology of connecting events to other events ( *ex: how the black plague was closely connected to economics*) that historians can run into the void of attempting to find the beginning.
- The struggle to find validity within ones own work and voice while analyzing the reasons of documents and the information within them.
