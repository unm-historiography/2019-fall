# What the Foucault?
So I thought we were already down the rabbit hole; I was wrong. Here we go with Foucault.

## Introduction
-The  recent trend in history had been towards “the emergence of long periods in history proper” (7) Think Braudel and the Annales school which favored long duration scales affected by geography and climate, for example, over short-term scales affected by events such as wars or government changes. 

-Contrastingly, a shift in the study of the history of thought was moving away from grand united spans of time and space, to a field focused on “the proliferation of discontinuities in the history of ideas” (7).  

-Foucault addresses **the changing role of the document**. For millennia the document has been a tool of historians used to reconstitute the past. However, Foucault argues that **“the document is no longer for history an inert material through which it tries to reconstitute what men have done or said**…history is now trying to define within the documentary material itself unities, totalities, series, relations” (7)…looking at documents in a meta sense—not what are they saying about something else, but what can we infer from them directly. 

-**Discontinuity is a paradox** because “it is both an instrument and an object of research” (9). 

-Foucault states that **total history is flawed** in the following ways and should be replaced with general history. 
Total history assumes that 
1. “it is possible to establish a system of homogenous relations” (9) 
2. that it is possible to use the same historical methods for any variety of social structures i.e. economic or social institutions, mental attitudes etc. (10)
3. that history can be divided into stages or units
Foucault states that his goal for this book is to “define a method of historical analysis freed from the anthropological theme” (16). What does he mean by anthropological in this sense? 

## Unities of Discourse
-I think **unity in discourse** relates to “a whole mass of notions…that diversifies a theme of continuity” (21), essentially a group of ideas, comments, corpora that share a common discourse. Foucault warns against accepting these groupings or unities without understanding where they come from.

-Notions of tradition, influence, evolution, and spirit, for example, can give a false sense of connectedness within a discourse. Foucault argues that **unity is not self-evident but instead is both variable and relative** (23). 

Stripping away notions of unity within subjects, allows us to look for discontinuity. We can better define the specificity of something if we can look at how it is discontinuous from other similar discourses. 

## Discursive Formations
Premise: “to describe the relations between statements” (31) and to discredit any unities trying to present themselves along the way. 
**How do we discover unity in discourse?** 

### Foucault’s four failed hypotheses:
1.	Refers to the same object at “simultaneous or successive emergence” (32)
2.	Defined by form and type of connections; things that have similar form and connections have unity in discourse. If form and connections change over time, is there still unity? 
3.	Coherence of concepts “in their simultaneous or successive emergence, in the distance that separates them, and even in their incompatibility” (35)…you lost me after successive emergence, Foucault. 
4.	Shared themes i.e. evolution or economics

**Is it better to look for dispersion or coherence to define a particular discourse?** 

It seems that Foucault is concluding that “one cannot discern a regularity” (37) through the use of any of this four methods. Is this true? Also, he recommends the use of tables of differences (37) like the linguists use. What would this look like in historical practice? 

**Finally, if the premise of Foucault's questions lies in the methods surrounding discourse, how do modern technologies like text mining and modeling complicate or make irrelevant Foucault's arguments?**
