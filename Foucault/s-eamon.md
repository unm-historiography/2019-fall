# Foucault's historiography, summarized. 

## Introduction

As with much of the rest of the readings, Foucault’s is a study in opposites. On the one hand, he opens with an explanation of how many historians are turning to ever-broader scales of time in their history, “trying to reveal the… underlying tendencies… that traditional history has covered with a thick layer of events” (3). In this, he purposely invokes geologic time scales in his choice of language, which even in translation gives a clear image of the historian as a geologist, chipping away at layers of rock. 

In marked contrast, he also investigates the then-burgeoning development of what we might consider micro-histories, to the point that “attention has been turned… away from vast unities like ‘periods’ or ‘centuries’ to the phenomena of rupture, or disunity” (4).

In response to this two-part split from traditional history, Foucault lays out the following response: “In short, the history of thought, of knowledge, of philosophy, of literature seems to be seeking, and discovering, more and more discontinuities, whereas history itself appears to be abandoning the irruption of events in favor of stable structures” (6). 

### The Document

The section discussing the new role of documents, though part of the introduction, seems to me to merit its own subsection. Foucualt points out that “the document, then, is no longer for history an inert material through which it tries to constitute what men have done or said… history is now trying to define within the documentary material itself unities, totalities, series, relations” (7). Rather than focusing only on what is written, modern historians look at the whole object to try and glean whatever information they can. Even the most traditional-seeming historian will now, when faced with a medieval manuscript for instance, investigate the composition of the ink, the type of handwriting, and the means of how the parchment itself was made. 

## The Unities of Discourse

In this section Foucault writes about the necessity of “[ridding] ourselves of a whole mass of notions, each of which, in its own way, diversifies the theme of continuity” (21). First up on the chopping block is tradition, closely followed by influence, development and evolution (considered as a whole), and lastly ‘spirit’.  Foucault warns that “we must question these ready-made syntheses, those groupings that we normally accept before any examination” (22). It all sounds very analytically philosophical. As an alternative, Foucault advises us to “accept, in the name of methodological rigour, that, in the first instance, they concern only a population of dispersed events” (22). In short, we must examine our assumptions, and not assign each “genre” a set of pre-determined methods and modes. 

## Discursive Formations

Here, Foucault conveniently focuses on four hypotheses, which serves a a useful focus for my summarizing.

- “Statements different in form, and dispersed in time, form a group if they refer to one and the same object” (32) As Foucault himself states, this seems to be “the most likely and the most easily proved”, (31-32). However, it can still be seen as moving away from traditional “oeuvres” or bodies of work by a single historian or a school, and more towards the more modern phenomenon of historical anthologies or other collections of a wide variety of essays and primary sources dedicated to a single subject. 

- The second hypothesis posits that to “define a group of relations between statements”, we should examine “their form and type of connexion [sic]” (33). Foucault here uses the example of 19th century medical literature to show how that field “no longer consisted of a group of traditions, observations, and heterogeneous practices, but of a corpus of knowledge that presupposed the same way of looking at things… the same analysis” (33). The applicability of this idea to history should be obvious.

- “Might it not be possible to establish groups of statements, by determining the system of permanent and coherent concepts involved?” (34). Here is where things really start to get into the weeds, but even here Foucault’s point is useful. He uses a linguistic example to start out with, but then admits the limitations of this hypothesis when applied to other concepts. 

- “A fourth hypothesis to regroup the statements, describe their interconnexion [sic] and account for the unitary forms under which they are presented: the identity and persistence of themes” (35). At first blush, it seems somewhat hypocritical of Foucault to advocate the use of anything as wooly as themes, which seem much too similar to the earlier derided ‘spirit’.  However, it seems that Foucault uses themes in a much more concrete way, stating that “a certain thematic is capable of linking, and animating a group of discourses” (35).
