### Introduction 

- History of thought is seeking discontinuities while history is seeking stable structures.
- The consequences of this new history
  * The breaking up of historical events into a series no longer defined by just dates but by things like 'relations.'
  * Discontinuity has a more prominent role int historical practice than ever before creating. Therefore the historian needs to focus on
     * periodization and analysis and the techniques he uses for each. 
     * the limits of description
     * specific form and function of what he or she is working on
- Total history is disappearing, making way for general history. General history is focused on series and the relationship between those series. While total history is focused on the entirety of a civilization. 
- Methodological problems that are both new and old being used or discarded.
Other notes: The new history is trying to aspire to be like archeology in technique.

### The methodological field of history and why it is important

- In specific ways, it has broken away from what at the time was the philosophy of history, therefore, making the way to ask new questions and break away from the old ones.
- This new methodology is intersecting with other fields that use the same methods to solve specific problems. Examples of these fields are linguistics and ethnology. 

### The Unities of Discourse
Things to question when it comes to unities.
- Groupings that have already been established through a historical process. 
- Groupings that have yet to be established. 
- The division of groupings as they are in themselves a discourse.

### Themes of discourse and things take the precaution of
- Avoid repetition, for it is a theme of discourse.
- Recognize that silence is a discourse and that something 'already said' is part of that discourse as well as the "semi-silence that precedes it." (pg. 25)
- Discourse is something that does not happen in the past but in the present.
- Discursive events are limited to language and are finite.
- With the erasure of unities, there will be a 
  * restoring of specificity
  * In letting go of other unities, one can describe new unities
- Discursive Formations
- Statements and the relationship between statements that cause discourse. 

### Hypotheses 
- First hypothesis- statements can be grouped over time to create or refer the same things or the same objects. Foucault talks about madness and how it was grouped with mental illness. I think the question that Foucault asks here then is there any validity in the grouping of statements? 
- Second hypothesis- Determine a group of statements and their relationship to one another. 
- Third Hypothesis-  The system of concepts as a mode for determining groups of statements.
- Fourth Hypothesis- Establish the themes of a statement and group them according to such.
