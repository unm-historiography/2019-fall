### Introduction ###

- “The old questions of the traditional analysis are now being replaced by questions of another type” (3-4). Where historians and those interested in history used to search for connections, patterns, and meanings behind events, the modern historian instead looks for isolation and series patterns within events. We are now looking to transform, and create new foundations, rather than continue to build upon the old ones. 

- History’s position, in relation to the document, has changed. Instead of using the document to understand what we can glean from it about the past, we are instead looking at the meaning of the document’s existence itself: what does it mean that this document exists, and how does it fit into the overall pattern of other documents we can obtain?

- People who are angry or scared about a loss of history are actually directing their fears in the wrong place. “What is being bewailed with such vehemence is not the disappearance of history” (14). They are scared of development and change in exchange for a safer option, that which is familiar. “...the eclipse of that form of history that was secretly, but entirely related to the synthetic activity of the subject…” (14).

- Foucault is attempting to “formulate tools”(16) that previous studies used and make sense of them in full for the future.

### The Unities of Discourse ###

- Like every historian before him that thought he was exceedingly clever, Foucault wishes us to rid ourselves of “a whole mass of notions” about history, etc. These notions include:
  - The notion of tradition: now we can redisperse the patterns of history.
  - The notion of influence: creates too much suggestion of a causal process that can not be proved, and is merely speculation.
  - The notions of development and evolution: apparently we aren’t allowed to find patterns anymore, even though it is a deeply psychologically ingrained process that Foucault also does.
  - The notion of ‘spirit’: No symbolic links, meanings, or collective consciousnesses are allowed here!
- Okay, here is where it gets extra special: No books, no oeuvres, no way.
  - The argument against the book is fairly simple. Outside of the obvious, modern binding of a physical book, the actual definition of the thing is unclear. It cannot be attributed to correlation in subject, because, for example, books of poetry are less connected than separate books of a series. It is “caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences: it is a node within a network” (23).
  - Oeuvre’s criticism makes even more sense. What an author puts together has no palpable boundaries: does one include his unpublished works, his letters, his grocery lists? The answer is a clear “no”, but then what published works are allowed? Would, for example, J.R.R. Tolkien’s Simarillion not be included because it is a group of his notes, not published until after his death?

### Discursive Formations ###

- Here, Foucault presents a problem with his approach. His more important of the two is “relations that may legitimately be described between the statements that have been left in their provisional, visible grouping” (31). What does this mean? I take it to mean that the disunity in discourse creates a problem. He provides four potential ‘solutions’.
  - Hypothesis One: “Statements different in form, and dispersed in time, form a group if they refer to one and the same object” (32).
  - Hypothesis Two: “define a group of relations between statements: their form and type of connection” (33).
  - Hypothesis Three: “might it not be possible to establish groups of statements, by determining the system of permanent and coherent concepts involved?” (34).
  - Hypothesis Four: “regroup the statements, describe their interconnexion and account for the unitary forms under which they are presented: the identity and persistence of themes” (35).
- He acknowledges the strengths and shortcomings of each one, calling them all failures, and reiterates the need to go beyond “familiar territory” (39) and into a promising future.
