## Nuance… what it all about?

Just based off the title of this article you get an idea that **Nuance** is not welcomed in any part of history. Kieran Healy is defining Nuance as a particular type of strategy that can be used in the fields of study like math, science, sociology, and history. But this strategy is meant to add on a “layer” of **Sophistication**.  She continues to say that the more Sophisticated something sounds I any of those fields that means there is more knowledge and truth from the individual. I honestly cracked up when reading this due to the fact I know many individuals who would agree with this concept, my father being one of them. The more “fancy” terminology used to identify and define a topic is surly it will always bring more attention and be inherently correct.
 
## Is there value through Nuance?

In full respect there is always a value to historical works that use nuance to help its understanding. All scholars in their writings and works are looking for a new perspective that separates from the previous scholars. But from a personal opinion, there really isn’t any need for nuance in historical work. It’s all flashy in its presentation. Collectively the sophistication on words are not entirely bad, but if it gets in the way of the theory it could be misleading to the readers on how to interpret their work. And in history we study to seek a truth, and if there’s a compromise we may not see or look over the truth. 
 
## Is Success possible through Nuance?

While reading I felt that there is always an idea in these fields that we need to develop or find the next groundbreaking discovery. But after when going through my one method and practices I personally don’t believe that the author uses Nuance correctly. Yes, it supposes to bring a different shade of meaning to particular words, and make it sound more appealing. But in no way is there but in no way is it the correct or right way, it’s just added on **fluff and prettiness** to disguise the way we look to change society. How much progression is made with Nuance? I feel very little growth comes from it. But the way our society looks for the up and coming next thing in any field we study, we have to roll with it and either embrace it or stay frustrated deal with it.
