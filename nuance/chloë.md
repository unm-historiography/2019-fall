### Reader's warning: I was very sick while writing this, so please forgive any rambling or nonsensical thought ###

This article certainly applies to history, but from what we’ve read this semester, I’d venture to say it doesn’t apply as well. When we take the sheer amount of analytic philosophers of history and Rankean historians, you get a certain degree less of a push for nuance throughout the field.

### Is history a matter of Nuance? ###
I don’t like the words ‘all’ or ‘none’, which may be symptomatic of my own ‘connoisseur’ nuance. Regardless, as ironic as it may seem, it’s not quite that simple. I would say the vast majority of the philosophy of history has been rooted in a search for nuance, both **before and after Ranke**. I would also say that a great deal of histories, methodologically speaking, have searched not for nuance but for record-keeping.

### Value of adding nuance to history? ###
History, like many of the humanities, can benefit from a more complex description of ‘what happened’. That being said, it is not always beneficial to do so. My main concern with nuance is that adding it makes the subject less and less accessible to the layperson. This continues to reserve knowledge to academics alone and does not invite outsider opinion, which I think leads to a certain amount of groupthink among the field.

### Should scale determine value? ###
The short answer: **it shouldn’t**. Every piece of history, accurate or not, long-durée or short, has its value within the field. I know I’m going to get a lot of flack for this, and I know that there are plenty of histories I don’t agree with. But when it comes down to it, each piece of history we write also becomes a piece which sheds a light into our current culture for future historians to unpack.


### Again, sorry. Brain isn't working. ###
I’m going to have to skip the question about models. Why? Because in my cold-induced brain fog, I seem to not be able to grasp how these work and why they’re important. *Sorry.*

### On digital archives ###
I’m going to go ahead and answer the last two questions together for this one. I think many historical laws are already important to historians, but I venture to say that the rise of a digital archive will be, in the short term, detrimental to the standardization of the field. Granted, I don’t think this is a bad thing, because it opens the field up to new theories and new methodology aside from post-modernism. I think it’s time the historical field let some fresh blood in and began to approach history in different ways. 

### One last thing ###
Let me finish by saying this: Fuck Nuance was one of the best readings we’ve had this entire semester. Healy was clear, driven, and made sense in a way that so many academics we’ve read haven’t been. That’s part of the problem not just in history and sociology, but in all academic fields right now. Healy not only argues, but also demonstrates, that you can be well-researched, analytical, and intelligent, while also creating a piece of writing **people actually want to read**.
