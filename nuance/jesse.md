## Fuck Nuance Am I right?

Nuance is present throughout many different fields but its not necesssarily the most important factor in any field. Nuance could also be defined as complexity in my mind. With this definition in play I think that nuance does have importance to many fields (namely math, science, economics, etc.) Complexity allows you to dive deep into subjects and begin to understand them more fully. That being said, nuance can create frustration in the mind of the academic. It creates frustration in the fact that one cannot ever fully know the nuance of a subject, there are always more levels of complexity to discover. 

## Nuance in History

I don't think that I have ever dealt with the term "nuance" in history before. That does not mean it isn't present though. Nuance to me is a relatively new phenomenon in history (i.e. microhistory). For the past 1800 years or so there has only been macro and meta histories. Microhistory became relevant within the last 150 years or so with the postmodern movement. Nuance seems to be the main facet of microhistory because it is the most necessary part of the discipline. Nuance is undeniable to the importance of microhistory.

## Nuance: Obnoxious and Necessary

 "As noted at the outset, there is no point in arguing against “nuance” as such, only its practical manifestation in our field at present. Actually-Existing Nuance is not equivalent to making some distinctions,trying to be careful about one’s argument, or counting to three. Nor is it simply the opposite of being stupid. Indeed, the tendency to equate a taste for nuance with intelligence as such is simply another tool of the connoisseur." Nuance, however difficult to discover fully has become a part of life for the connoisseur and if not created by an individual but rather discovered by him can be a useful tool to discover a topic more intently.
