# Fuck Nuance
-	*Do you reject my premise that this article applies equally well to history?*

To say **“that ‘nuance’ is something one does when they do not have an interesting or compelling answer” (p.2).** I would agree with the author that not only in the field of sociology, but in most academic disciplines to include history. So that being said, I do not reject your premise, I agree with it. **“The most important thing about a theory is whether it is any good” (p.5).** So if a theory is not any good, a subtle spin of ‘nuance’ is not going to produce any progress no matter the subject. However, if the theory being dealt with is solid, it simply needs some contemporary additives to allow it to thrive in the period of time, then nuance can be a good thing. On that note, I do not entirely agree with Healy in that ‘nuance’ is always bad. As time progresses, so must everything else, such as theories, methodologies etc. Most everything is in a constant state of evolution, those that are not probably have ceased to exist. 

-	*Besides making for a good story, is there value in historical work that simply adds nuance to widely accepted understandings of the past?*

The answer to this question in my opinion is both yes and no. When there is something added to a historical work that is widely accepted it can be that this last piece complete the puzzle, when before adding ‘nuance’ it seemed one-sided, or to be missing something. On the other-hand, if one simply cannot come up with something of concrete evidence and importance, don’t put a lazy spin on it just to attain recognition as this only muddies the water of the topic.

-	*How might a digital archive challenge traditional historical authority?*

Digital archives may challenge “traditional historical authority” in several ways. Firstly, the ease of access allows many who would otherwise not have it. One does not have to go to a specific physical place to view the archives, so they can spend more time, connecting ‘dots’ that would have otherwise, either not have been connected, or, it would have taken much longer. Secondly, aspects such as oral histories are much more attainable than traditionally. Lastly, the simple speed of access on a digital archive allows people to triangulate commonalities that through looking up by hand would not be such a simple task.
