## Wait, this isn’t about History! 

I do agree with the premise that nuance is present in ever-increasing amounts in history, but I’m not sure that it can be universally described as a vice in a historical (or indeed historiographical) context. I think that nuance has a time and place. It should not be universally applied, as the Healy implies it is in sociological writing, like a thick layer of paint to cover up poor authorial workmanship, but it not wholly out of place. On the other hand, one can see the increased use of nuance in history as a result of the ponderous weight of preexisting history. There is a sense that all the “simple” historical work has already been done and redone, and all that is left is that which is complicated, complex, in a word, nuanced.  

### Does Nuance have value?  

I do think that there is some value in more nuanced works, in relation with more straightforward works. Nuance can give more or deeper detail, can get into the weeds in a way that simpler, more theory-driven works do not. However, I think it’s a trap to try and say that more nuanced works have more value than less nuanced ones, or vice versa. I think it would be more accurate to say that they have different values depending on the contexts of their creation and/or use. I also must say that as something of a perpetrator of purple prose in my own historical writing, I do disagree with Healy on general aesthetic terms. In this arena too, there is a place for both extremes. 

### Oh God, why is there math in my History? 

Is history well-served by models? Once again, I will equivocate until I’m blue in the face. It depends on what you’re doing. In a modern macro or mezzo history (did I just create that term? Can I patent that?), it’s hard not to turn to models, and likewise in some subfields, such as economic history. One the other hand, I don’t think that models have much place in microhistories. And do they need math? Yeah, probably.  

### Some thoughts on this new-fangled digital stuff. 

I’m not entirely sure what is meant by historical laws, so I’m going to ignore that one. As to how a digital archive will challenge historical authority, I think in the same way that digital anything challenges any authority. As old archives are made available digitally, and newly created archives are digital from the beginning, those resources are becoming more readily available, and it is becoming harder and harder for the traditional historical academe to restrict access to resources to those who they think deserve it. It’s simply another form of gatekeeping that hopefully will be disapearing.
